WARNING
Any distraction may lead to an accident, with the risk of injury.
? Do not operate the instrument cluster con- trols when driving.
? To reduce the risk of accident and injury, only make adjustments to the instructions on the instrument cluster display and to the instructions on the Infotainment system dis- play when the vehicle is stationary.

Digital Cockpit

systems, among other things. From here on the Digital Cockpit will be referred to as the "digital instrument cluster".

Views in the display area
The digital instrument cluster can display the following views ››› Fig. 1:
? Summary: Before switching on the drive sys- tem: view with information on mileage (km), battery state of charge and range.
? Basic: Driving indications with information on driver assistant systems, speed and naviga- tion.
? Driver assistant systems: Display of active driver assistant systems and speed. The navi- gation context is hidden.

Instrument cluster
Introduction
After switching the drive system on with a 12- volt battery that is heavily discharged or newly replaced, some system settings (such as the time, the date, the personalised comfort set- tings and the programming) might be altered or deleted. Check and correct these settings once the battery is sufficiently charged.










The Digital Cockpit is a digital instrument clus- ter with a high-resolution colour liquid crystal display. In addition to the speedometer, by se- lecting different information profiles you can display information from the driver assistant
? 
Navigation: Representation with information about the guided route and speed. The graphic view of the driver assistant systems is hidden.
Items such as pop-up windows are displayed in the upper display area, depending on the situation.
The amount and content of the information displayed may vary depending on the equip- ment.

Adjusting the views
The different views give you a better overview of driving and navigation data or information on driver assistant systems.


15




The	button on the multifunction steering wheel can be used to switch between the over- view and the reduced view of the instrument cluster.
? To switch between views, tap the button or press or swipe your finger over the buttons or .

Incidents on the digital instrument cluster
Information and warnings are displayed on the digital instrument cluster as incidents. In- cidents are displayed at the top of the instru-
ment cluster and are hidden again after a short time.


Battery state of charge and range on the digital instrument cluster








Battery state of charge indication
The current state of charge of the high-voltage battery is indicated by the	symbol on the
digital instrument cluster ››› Fig. 2 1 . The
battery symbol will be more or less full depend- ing on the state of charge of the battery.

Range indication
The vehicle range is displayed in kilometres (km) or miles (mi) depending on the selected
setting ››› Fig. 2 2 .
The displayed value is calculated and updated based on the driving style and ambient condi- tions. Hence, the range may vary even with the high-voltage battery fully charged.

Remaining battery charge time indicator
During an active charging process, the remain- ing charging time to the desired state of charge is displayed on the instrument cluster. This in- formation is only displayed if the ignition is off (by pressing the	button).

Reserve area ››› Fig. 2
1 Battery state of charge, percentage charge and range
2 Reserve indication (warning level 1), per- centage charge and range
3 Reserve indication (warning level 2), per- centage charge and range
Reserve area warning levels:
Yellow The battery state of charge is lower than 20 %.
Red The battery state of charge is lower than 10 %.

››› .


16




Power display

The current drive power is displayed dynami- cally on a bar with a lighter colour, either as re- cuperation power (light green), left, or as drive power (light blue), right.
When the current drive power and current power availability are the same (the segments are the same length), the power limit of the electric motor has been reached.







The power display shows the current electric motor power availability and the current drive power.

Display system
On the circular segments, the power display always shows the availability of brake energy
recuperation ››› Fig. 3 1 (green) on the left hand side and power availability ››› Fig. 3 2
(blue) on the right hand side.
When the corresponding section of the seg- ment reaches the end mark, availability is un- limited. If there is a limitation, the segment is shortened accordingly.

Relevant factors
Aside from the speed of the vehicle, the fol- lowing factors are also relevant:
? The availability of drive and recuperation de- pends on the state of charge of the high volt- age battery. If its state of charge is high, recu- peration may be limited; if it is low, drive may be limited.
? If the temperature of the high voltage bat- tery is very low or very high, the available drive power may be reduced in general. This affects drive and recuperation.

Road signs detection sys- tem
Introduction1)
The dynamic road sign display system records standard traffic signs by means of a camera located in the upper central area of the wind- screen, housed in the compartment at the base of the interior mirror, and reports any speed restrictions, overtaking prohibitions and warning signs that it recognises.
Within its limitations, the system also displays a additional sign to indicate aspects such as temporary prohibitions. Even on routes with- out signs, the system can, if necessary, display the applicable speed limits.
Road sign recognition does not work in all countries. Keep this in mind when travelling abroad.

The additional signs are displayed on the Head-up-Display and on the instrument clus- ter as generic additional signs.

Shown on the display






In Germany, on motorways and normal roads for vehicles, besides speed limits and overtak- ing provisions the system also displays end of restriction signs. In all other countries the cur- rently valid speed limit is displayed instead.
The road signs detected by the system are displayed on the instrument cluster display
››› Fig. 7 and, depending on the navigation
system fitted in the vehicle, in the infotainment system as well .
Depending on the equipment, an indication is also displayed on the Head-up-Display.

Display of road signs
After checking and evaluating the information from the camera, the infotainment system and actual vehicle data, the system displays up to two current road signs, and a generic addi-
tional sign ››› Fig. 7:
? First: The sign that is currently valid for the driver is displayed on the left hand side of the screen, e.g. a prohibition of driving at over 130 km/h (80 mph).
? Second: Another road sign, such as a warn- ing sign, can be displayed in second place.
? Additional sign: If an additional sign is de- tected, e.g. for temporary limits, it is shown be- low the valid road sign. For system reasons, a generic sign is displayed instead of the actual detected sign.
The valid road sign is displayed on the Head- up-Display by the generic additional sign.
The warning sign display is not available in all countries and the system may not be able to detect all existing warning signs.

No entry sign
The road sign recognition system gives a warn- ing on the instrument cluster when a no entry sign is passed on a one-way road or an en- trance to a motorway or highway.



1) Not available in all markets.
26




Limited operation
The road sign detection system has certain limitations. The following cases may cause the system to function in a limited way or not at all:
? Poor visibility, e.g. in snow, rain, fog or in- tense mist.
? Dazzling, e.g. caused by head-on traffic or by the sun.
? Driving at high speed.
? If the camera is covered or dirty.
? If the road signs are partially or totally ob- structed, e.g. by trees, snow, dirt or other vehi- cles.
? Non-compliant road signs.
? Damaged or bent road signs.
? Variable message signs on signalling gantries (variable indication of road signs by LEDs or other lighting units).
? If outdated maps are used in the navigation system.
? Adhesives affixed to vehicles that depict road signs, e.g. speed limits on lorries.

Safety is everybody's business.


Correct sitting position of vehicle occupants
Correct position on the seat

















The correct sitting positions for the driver and passengers are shown below.
If your physical constitution prevents you from maintaining the correct sitting position, con- tact a specialised workshop for help with
any special devices. The seat belt and airbag can only provide optimum protection if a cor- rect sitting position is adopted. CUPRA recom- mends taking your car in for technical service.
For your own safety and to reduce the risk of injury in the event of an accident or sudden braking or manoeuvre, CUPRA recommends the following positions:



1) The front seats with built-in headrests do not require adjustment.
38




Valid for all vehicle occupants:
? Adjust the head restraint so that its upper edge is, as far as possible, at the same level as the top of your head, as close to eye level
as possible1) ››› page 116. Keep the back of
your neck as close as possible to the headrest
››› Fig. 15.
? Always keep your feet in the footwell while the vehicle is in motion.
? Adjust and fasten your seat belt correctly
››› page 40.
The following also applies to the driver:
? Move the seat backrest to an almost upright position so that your back rests completely against it.
? Adjust the steering wheel so that it is at a distance of at least 25 cm (10 inches) from the
sternum ››› Fig. 14 and can hold it with both
hands on the sides, on the outside, with the arms slightly flexed.
? The steering wheel must always point to- wards the chest and never towards the face.
? Adjust the seat lengthwise so that you can fully step on the pedals with your knees slightly bent and there is a distance between the knee area and the instrument panel of at least 10 cm
(4 inches) ››› Fig. 15.
? 
Adjust the height of the seat so that you can reach the top of the steering wheel.
? Always keep both feet in the footwell so that you have the vehicle under control at all times.

For the passenger, the following applies:
? Move the seat backrest to an almost upright position so that your back rests completely against it.
? Move the seat as far back as possible (mini- mum 25 cm between the chest and the instru- ment panel check translation). If you are sitting closer than 25 cm, the airbag system cannot protect you properly.


Number of seats
The vehicle has 5 seats, 2 in the front and 3 in the rear. All seats are fitted with a safety belt.
Check the official documentation for the num- ber of occupants approved for your vehicle.




Risks of sitting in an incorrect posi- tion
If seat belts are worn incorrectly or not at all, the risk of severe or fatal injuries increases. Seat belts can provide optimal protection only if the belt web is properly worn. Incorrect sit-

ting positions substantially reduce the protec- tive function of seat belts and, therefore, in- crease the risk of severe or even fatal injuries. The risk of severe or fatal injuries is especially heightened when a deploying airbag strikes a vehicle occupant who has assumed an incor- rect sitting position. The driver is responsible for all people, particularly children, inside the vehicle.
The following list contains examples of incor- rect sitting positions that could be dangerous for all vehicle occupants.

When the vehicle is in motion:
? Never stand in the vehicle.
? Never stand on the seats.
? Never kneel on the seats.
? Never tilt your seat backrest too far to the rear.
? Never lean against the dash panel.
? Never lie on the rear seats.
? Never sit on the front edge of a seat.
? Never sit sideways.
? Never lean out of a window.
? Never put your feet out of a window.
? Never put your feet on the dash panel.
? Never place your feet on the bench or on the backrest of the seat.
? Never travel in a footwell.
? Never sit on the armrests.
? 
Never travel without wearing the seat belt.
? Never travel in the luggage compartment.

Seat belts
Introduction








Properly worn seat belts hold the occupants in the proper position. They also help prevent
uncontrolled movements that may result in se- rious injury and reduce the risk of being thrown out of the vehicle in case of an accident.
Vehicle occupants wearing their seat belts cor- rectly benefit greatly from the ability of the belts to absorb kinetic energy. In addition, the front part of your vehicle and other passive safety features (such as the airbag system) are designed to absorb the kinetic energy released in a collision. Taken together, all these features reduce the released kinetic energy and conse-

quently, the risk of injury. This is why it is so important to fasten seat belts before every trip, even when "just driving around the corner".
Ensure that your passengers wear their seat belts as well. Accident statistics have shown that wearing seat belts is an effective means of substantially reducing the risk of injury and im- proving the chances of survival when involved in a serious accident. Furthermore, properly worn seat belts improve the protection provi- ded by airbags in the event of an accident. For this reason, wearing a seat belt is required by law in most countries.
Although your vehicle is equipped with airbags, the seat belts must be fastened and worn. The front airbags, for example, are only triggered in some cases of head-on collision. The front air- bags will not be triggered during minor head- on or side collisions, rear-end collisions, over- turns or accidents in which the airbag trigger threshold value in the control unit is not ex- ceeded.

Important safety instructions for the use of seat belts
? Always wear the seat belt as described in this section.
? Ensure that the seat belts can be fastened at all times and are not damaged.

signal will sound for 126 seconds. In addition, the warning lamp on the instrument cluster display flashes.
The lamp goes out when the ignition is on and all occupants have fastened their seat belts.

Head-on collisions and the laws of physics



When the ignition is switched on, the seat belt status display ››› Fig. 17 informs the driver on
the instrument cluster display whether the oc- cupants have their seat belts fastened.
Depending on seat occupancy and the status of the seat belts, the vehicle's seats will light up in different colours:
A grey light indicates that the correspond- ing seat is not occupied.
A green light indicates that the seat is oc- cupied and the occupant is wearing the seat belt.
A red light indicates that the seat is occu- pied and the occupant is not wearing the seat belt.
If a speed of 25 km/h (15 mph) is exceeded after moving off without the driver or a front passenger seatbelt being fastened, or if the seatbelt is unfastened while driving, an audible



The effects of the laws of physics in the case of a head-on collision are easy to explain: the moment a vehicle starts moving, a type of en- ergy called "kinetic energy" starts acting on both the vehicle and its passengers.
The amount of "kinetic energy" depends on the speed of the vehicle and on the weight
of the vehicle and of its passengers. The taller they are, the more energy there is to be "ab- sorbed" in the event of an accident.
The most significant factor, however, is the speed of the vehicle. If the speed doubles from 25 km/h (15 mph) to 50 km/h (30 mph), for example, the corresponding kinetic energy is multiplied by four.


42




Even at speeds of 30 km/h (19 mph) to 50 km/h (30 mph), the forces acting on bodies in a collision can easily exceed one tonne (1000 kg). At greater speed these forces are even higher.
Vehicle occupants not wearing seat belts are not "attached" to the vehicle. In a head-on collision, they will move forward at the same speed their vehicle was travelling just before the impact. This example applies not only to head-on collisions, but to all accidents and collisions.
Even at low speeds the forces acting on the body in a collision are so great that it is not possible to brace oneself with one's hands. In the event of a head-on collision, vehicle occu- pants not wearing a seat belt will be thrown uncontrollably forward and will collide, for ex- ample, against the steering wheel, dash panel
or windscreen ››› Fig. 18.
It is also important for rear passengers to wear seat belts properly, as they could otherwise be thrown forward violently through the vehicle interior in an accident. If a rear seat occupant is not wearing a seat belt, they are not only en- dangering themselves but also the occupants
of the front seats ››› Fig. 19.

Fastening and unfastening the seat belt









Fastening the seat belt
Fasten your seat belt before each trip.
? Adjust the front seat and headrest correctly
››› page 38.
? Engage the seat backrest of the rear seat in an upright position ››› .
? Pull the latch plate and place the belt web- bing evenly across your chest and lap. Do not
twist the seat belt when doing so ›››  .
? Insert the buckle plate in the buckle of the correct seat ››› Fig. 20.
? Pull the belt to ensure that the latch plate is securely engaged in the buckle.

Releasing the seat belt
Only unfasten the seat belt when the vehicle has come to a standstill ››› .
? Press the red button on the buckle
››› Fig. 21. The latch plate is released from the
buckle.
? Guide the belt back by hand so that it rolls up easily and does not damage the trim.


Properly worn seat belts hold the vehicle occu- pants in the position that best protects them
in the event of an accident or sudden braking
››› .

43
















Correct position of the seat belt










Seat belts offer their maximum protection in the event of an accident and reduce the risk of sustaining severe or fatal injuries only when they are properly positioned. Furthermore, if the webbing is correctly positioned, the seat belt will hold the vehicle occupants in the op- timum position to ensure the airbag provides the maximum protection. The seat belt must
therefore always be worn and the webbing cor- rectly positioned.
Incorrectly worn seat belts can cause severe or even fatal injuries ››› page 38, Correct sitting position of vehicle occupants.
? The shoulder part of the seat belt must lie
on the centre of the shoulder, never across the neck or the arm, under the arm or behind the shoulder.
? 
The lap part of the seat belt must lie across the pelvis, never across the stomach.
? The seat belt must lie flat and fit comfortably. Pull the belt tight if necessary to take up any slack.
In the case of pregnant women, the seat belt should pass uniformly over the chest and as low as possible through the pelvic area with the strap flat so it does not press down on the ab- domen; in addition, it must be used through-
out the entire pregnancy ››› Fig. 23.
Adapting the position of the belt webbing to your size
The seat belt can be adapted using the follow- ing equipment:
? Front seat belts with height adjustment.
? Front seat height adjustment.




44


Seat belt height adjustment













Using the height adjusters for the front seats, the position of the seat belts can be adjusted in the shoulder area according to the height of the occupant, so that the seatbelt can be fastened correctly:
? Keep the guide device pressed down in the direction of the arrow ››› Fig. 24.
? Move the guide device up or down until the seat belt lies over the centre of your shoulder
››› page 44, Correct position of the seat
belt.
? Release the guide device.
? Pull the belt sharply to check that the device is engaged securely.


Automatic retractor, tensioner and belt force limiter
Vehicle seat belts are part of the vehicle's safety system ››› page 38. This system has the following important functions:

Automatic belt retractor
The seat belt shoulder straps on the driver's and front passenger seats, as well as those on the rear side seats (and, depending on equip- ment, also the seat belt of the central rear seat) are fitted with automatic retractors. This device ensures complete freedom of move- ment when the shoulder strap is pulled gently or during normal driving. However, during sud- den braking, when driving in the mountains, around bends and when accelerating, the re- tractor locks the seat belt if it extends rapidly.
In critical driving situations, e.g. in the event of emergency braking or in the case of over- steer and understeer, the proactive occupant protection can tension the front seat belts au-
tomatically if they are worn1). The two belts are loosened again if an accident does not happen


1) Only if fitted with the PreCrash System.
45




or when the critical situation passes. Proactive occupant protection is ready to operate again
››› page 47.
Seat belt tensioner
The seat belts on the front seats and side rear seats are fitted with tensioners.
The tensioners are activated by sensors in the event of severe head-on, side and rear colli- sions or the vehicle rolling over, and tension the seat belts in a direction opposite their ex- tension.
If the seat belt is slack, the tensioner tightens it. This cushions the forward movement of oc- cupants towards the impact.
The belt pre-tensioners work in combination with the airbag system. If the vehicle overturns, the pre-tensioners do not activate unless the head airbags are deployed.
When activated, a fine powder may be re- leased. This is completely normal and it is not an indication of fire in the vehicle.




Reversible belt tensioning (proactive occu- pant protection)
A reversible tensioning of the seat belts may occur in certain driving situations
››› page 47. For example:
? in the event of sudden braking
? in the event of oversteering or understeering
? in the event of minor collisions

Belt force limiter
The front and rear side seat belts are equipped with force limiters. In the event of an accident, the seat belt force limiter reduces the force the seat belt exerts on the body.


Maintenance and disposal of seat belt tensioners
The belt tensioners are components of the seat belts that are installed in the seats of your vehicle. If you work on the belt tensioners or remove and install parts of the system when performing other repair work, the seat belt may be damaged. The consequence may be that, in the event of an accident, the belt ten- sioners function incorrectly or may not func- tion at all.


1) Only if fitted with the PreCrash System.

The PreCrash system is an assistance system that actives a series of measures to protect the occupants of the vehicles in potentially risky situations, but which cannot prevent a collision.
It only works completely if no special driving profile is selected and if there are no operating anomalies.

At the start of each journey and depending on the time of use and the speed of the vehicle, the seatbelt is automatically pretensioned in order to reduce slack in the driver's and front passenger's seatbelts, provided they are buck- led.

Basic features
Depending on the legal provisions of the coun- try and the features of the vehicle, in critical situations (e.g. in certain cases of emergency braking or loss of control of the vehicle by the driver) the following functions can be activated separately or at the same time when the vehi- cle is travelling faster than approximately 30 km/h (20 mph).

is only a crack left.
Depending on how critical the driving situation is, the belts are either tightened individually, or both belts at the same time.

In addition to Front Assist
In vehicles with Front Assist ››› page 188, within the limits of the system, information is assessed on the risk of collision with the ve- hicle in front. The functions of the PreCrash system may also be activated if there is a high likelihood of a rear-end collision, or during the activation of Front Assist.

In addition to Side Assist
In vehicles with Side Assist,››› page 200, within the limitations of this system, informa- tion is assessed on the risk of collision with traffic to the rear of the vehicle. If a rear-end collision is highly likely, the functions of the PreCrash system may also be activated. In this situation, the hazard warning lights are turned on with a higher frequency of flashes.




47




In addition to the Emergency Assist system
In vehicles with emergency assist, driver status information is assessed within the limitations of this system. The following PreCrash systems may be activated if a lack of activity is detec- ted:
? Reversible seat belt tensioning of the driver's seat belt.
? Automatic closing of the windows until they are just cracked open and, depending on the equipment, of the sunroof.

Activating the PreCrash system
The PreCrash system can be partially deactiva- ted by deactivating the traction and/or stability control, depending on the equipment. When these vehicle safety controls are switched on (by default, every time the ignition is turned on), the system is fully activated.

Driving profile selection settings
In vehicles with driving profile selection, Pre- Crash adapts to suit the special vehicle configuration of the corresponding profile
››› page 162.
Limited operation
The PreCrash system is not available or only has limited availability in the following situa- tions:
? 
When the TCS and/or ESC is off.
? When driving in reverse.
? When the airbag control unit is not operating properly.
? When there is a fault in the system itself, in the ESC or in the Front Assist.

Troubleshooting
If the PreCrash is not working correctly, the message System unavailable or System with limited functions is shown permanently on the instrument cluster screen. Go to a speci- alized CUPRA Service or Official SEAT Service and ask for the system to be checked.





Airbag system
Why is it so important to wear a seat belt and to sit correctly?
For the inflating airbags to achieve the best protection, the seat belt must always be worn properly and the correct sitting position must be assumed.
The airbag system is not a substitute for seat belts, but it is an integral part of the vehicle's overall passive safety system. Please bear in mind that the airbag system can only work ef- fectively when the vehicle occupants are wear- ing their seat belts correctly and have adjusted the headrests properly. Therefore, it is most important to properly wear the seat belts at


48




all times, not only because this is required by law in most countries, but also for your safety
››› page 40, Seat belts.
The airbag inflates in a matter of seconds, so if you are not properly seated when the airbag is triggered, you may sustain fatal injuries. There- fore, it is essential that all vehicle occupants assume a correct sitting position while travel- ling.
Sharp braking before an accident may cause a passenger not wearing a seat belt to be thrown forward into the area of the deploying airbag. In this case, the inflating airbag may inflict criti- cal or fatal injuries on the occupant. This also applies to children.
Always maintain the greatest possible distance between yourself and the front airbag. This way, the front airbags can completely deploy when triggered, providing their maximum pro- tection.
The most important factors for triggering the airbag are the type of accident, the angle of impact and the vehicle speed.
Whether or not the airbags are activated de- pends primarily on the vehicle deceleration rate resulting from the collision and detected by the control unit. If the vehicle deceleration occurring during the collision and measured by the control unit remains below the specified reference values, the front, side and/or curtain airbags will not be triggered. Take into account that the visible damage in a vehicle involved

in an accident, no matter how serious, is not a factor that determines whether or not the airbags are activated.



Description of the airbag system
The airbag system offers additional protection for the occupants in combination with the seat belts.

The airbag system comprises the following modules (as per vehicle equipment):
? Electronic control unit
? Front airbags for driver and passenger
? Side airbags
? Central airbag for the driver
? 
Head airbag
? Airbag control lamp on the instrument panel ››› page 50
? Key-operated switch for front passenger air- bag
? Control lamp for disabled/enabled status of the front passenger airbag.
The airbag system operation is monitored electronically. The airbag control lamp will illu- minate for a few seconds every time the igni- tion is switched on (self-diagnosis).

There is a fault in the system if the control lamp :
? does not light up when the ignition is switched on ››› page 50,
? turns off after 4 seconds after the ignition is switched on,
? turns off and then lights up again after the ignition is switched on,
? illuminates or flashes while the vehicle is moving.

Situations in which the airbags will not nec- essarily deploy:
? the ignition is switched off
? there is a minor frontal collision
? there is a minor side collision
? there is a rear-end collision


49




? in the event of the vehicle overturning if the dynamic characteristics measured by the con- trol unit are too low,
? the impact speed is lower than the reference value programmed in the control unit.


Airbag activation
The airbags deploy extremely rapidly, within thousandths of a second, to provide additional protection in the event of an accident. A fine dust may develop when the airbag deploys.
This is normal and it is not an indication of fire in the vehicle.
The airbag system is only ready to function when the ignition is on.
In special accidents instances, several airbags may activate at the same time.
Airbags do not activate in the event of minor head-on and side collisions or rear-end colli- sions.

Activation factors
The conditions that lead to the airbag system activating in each situation cannot be general- ised. Some factors play an important role, such as the properties of the object the vehicle hits (hard/soft), angle of impact, vehicle speed, etc.
Deceleration trajectory is key for airbag activa- tion.
The control unit analyses the collision trajec- tory and activates the respective restraint sys- tem.
If the deceleration rate is below the predefined reference value in the control unit the airbags will not be triggered, even though the accident may cause extensive damage to the car.

The following airbags are triggered in serious head-on collisions:
? Driver airbag.
? Front passenger front airbag
? Head airbags.

In the event of serious side collisions, some (or all) of the following airbags can be acti- vated (depending on the severity of the col- lision):
? Head airbags.
? Front side airbag on the side of the accident.
? Central airbag.

In an accident with airbag activation:
? the interior lights switch on (if the interior light switch is in the courtesy light position);
? the hazard warning lights switch on;
? all doors are unlocked;
? the high voltage system is switched off;
? an emergency call is started.

Airbag system control lamps
 Lights up on the instrument cluster Fault in the airbag system and seat belt tensioners. Have the system checked im- mediately by a specialised workshop.

 Lights up on the instrument cluster Airbag or belt tensioner system deacti- vated by a diagnostic tester. Contact a specialised workshop and get it to check whether the airbag or belt tensioner sys- tem should remain deactivated.

Lights up on the roof console

Lights up on the roof console
Front passenger airbag activated. The control lamp turns off automatically 60 seconds after the ignition is switched on.


50




Several warning and control lamps light up for a few seconds when the ignition is switched on, signalling that the function is being verified.
They will switch off after a few seconds.
If the airbag and seat belt tensioner system control lamp  remains on or flashes, it indi- cates a malfunction in the airbag and seat belt
tensioner system ›››	. Have the system
checked immediately by a specialised work- shop.
If the front passenger airbag has been deacti- vated, the warning lamp	remains lit on the roof console to remind you that the airbag is deactivated. If, with the front passenger air- bag deactivated, this lamp does not remain lit or if it is lit along with the control lamp
on the instrument cluster, there is a fault in the airbag system ››› . If the control lamp is flashing, there is a fault in the disabling of the
airbag system ››› . Have the system checked
immediately by a specialised workshop.












Front airbags








The driver's front airbag is housed in the steer- ing wheel and that of the front passenger, on the dash panel. Airbags are identified by the word "AIRBAG".
The airbag covers open and remain attached to the steering wheel and instrument panel when the driver and front passenger air-
bags are triggered, respectively ››› Fig. 25 ,
››› Fig. 26.
In conjunction with the seat belts, the front airbag system gives the front occupants addi- tional protection for the head and chest in the
event of a severe frontal collision ›››  .
In addition, in certain head-on collisions, the head airbag is triggered on both sides of the vehicle.
Their special design allows the controlled es- cape of the propellant gas when an occupant puts pressure on the bag. Thus, the head and


51




chest are protected by the airbag. After the collision, the airbag deflates sufficiently to al- low visibility.

Activate and deactivate front pas- senger front airbag1)



















Deactivate the front passenger front airbag only if you have to use a rear-facing child seat in the front passenger seat.
CUPRA recommends fitting the child seat in the rear seat to avoid having to deactivate the front passenger airbag.
When the front passenger airbag is deactiva- ted, this means that only the front passenger front airbag is deactivated. All the other airbags in the vehicle remain activated.

Deactivate and activate the front passenger front airbag
? Disconnect the drive system.
? Open the passenger side door.
? Remove the key shaft from the vehicle key.
? Insert the key blade into the slot provided in the front passenger airbag disconnection
switch ››› Fig. 27. About 3/4 of the key should
enter; this is as far as it will go.
? Turn the key gently to change its position to (deactivate) or to  (activate). If you have
difficulty, ensure that you have inserted the key as far as it will go.
? Close the front passenger door.
? When deactivating the airbag, switch the ig- nition on and check that the control lamp
remains lit ››› Fig. 28.

52




? When reactivating the airbag, check that when the ignition is switched on, the control lamp does not light up and the
lamp lights up for 60 seconds and then turns off.

Central airbag

When triggered, the central airbag fills the marked zone (deployment zone) ››› Fig. 30. For this reason, never place or fix objects in this zone ››› .
The central airbag triggers in the case of a side collision or if the vehicle overturns, reducing the risk of vehicle occupants suffering injuries.
















The central airbag is installed for the front seats and is located in the inner padding of the driver's seat backrest.
The location of the central airbag is indicated by the inscription "AIRBAG" ››› Fig. 29.

53




Side airbags

Its location is marked with the word "AIRBAG" on the upper part of the back of the seats or on the lower coverings with the word AIRBAG in relief.

In conjunction with the seat belts, the side air- bag system provides additional protection for the upper body in the event of a severe side
collision ›››  .
In a side collision, the side airbags reduce the risk of injury to passengers to the areas of the body facing the impact. In addition to their normal protection, the seat belts also hold the passengers in the event of a side collision; this is how these airbags provide maximum protec- tion.











The side airbags are located in the front seat backrests ››› Fig. 31 , ››› Fig. 32.

Head-protection airbags

In combination with the seat belts, the Side Curtain Protection(r) airbags provide additional protection for the upper part of the body of vehicle occupants in the event of serious side
collisions or the vehicle overturning ›››  .
The framed area is covered by the head-pro- tection airbag when it is deployed (deployment
area) ››› Fig. 33. Therefore, objects should never be placed or mounted in this area ›››  .
In the event of a vehicle rollover, a side impact or certain head-on collisions, the head airbags on both sides are triggered.
The head-protection airbags reduce the risk of injury to passengers in the front and rear side seats facing the impact.










Head-protection airbags are on both sides of the passenger compartment, above the doors

Transporting children safely
Introduction
For safety reasons, as we have learned from accident statistics, we recommend that chil- dren under 12 years of age travel in the rear seats. Depending on their age, height and weight, children travelling in rear seats must use a child seat or a seat belt. For safety rea- sons, the child seat should be installed in the rear seat, behind the front passenger seat or in the centre back seat.
The laws of physics involved and the forces acting in a collision apply also to children
››› page 42. But unlike adults, children do not
have fully developed muscle and bone struc- tures. This means that children are subject to a greater risk of injury.
To reduce the risk of injuries, children must always use special child restraint systems when travelling in the vehicle.
We recommend the use of child safety products from the Genuine Accessories Pro- gramme, which includes systems for all ages (see www.cupraaccessories.com).

These systems have been especially de- signed and approved and comply with the UN ECE R129 (i-Size) regulation.
CUPRA recommends securing the child seats shown on the website as described below:
? Rear-facing child seat (group 0+): ISOFIX and support leg (Britax Römer Baby-Safe 3 i-SIZE + Flex Base i-SENSE).
? Forward-facing child seat (group 1): ISOFIX AND Top Tether (Britax Römer TRIFIX 2 i-Size).
? Forward-facing child seat (group 2): seat belt and ISOFIX (Britax Römer KIDFIX i-Size). You must also use the seat's "Secure-Guard" seat- belt connection point and adjust the side im- pact protection system "SICT" (available on certain models), located in the seat backrest. Adjust only the "SICT" closest to the door. Please follow the child seat manufacturer's us- age instructions.
? Forward-facing child seat (group 3): seat belt and ISOFIX (Britax Römer KIDFIX i-Size). Group 3 can use the seat with backrest or only the seat base without the backrest (booster). The backrest of the child seat has an adult seat belt guide and a head restraint, meaning that the seat with the backrest offers better protection than boosters without backrests. CUPRA rec- ommends the use of child seats with backrests.
Follow the manufacturer's instructions and ob- serve any statutory requirements when instal- ling and using child seats. Always read and note
››› page 58.


56




We recommend you always carry the manufac- turer's Child Seat Instruction Manual together with the on-board documentation.

Child seats group classification










Use only child seats that are officially approved and suitable for the child.
These seats are subject to the ECE-R44 or ECE-R129 standards. ECE-R stands for: Eco- nomic Commission for Europe Regulation.

Child seats by weight group
The child seats are grouped into 5 categories:


Age groupWeight of the childGroup 0Up to 10 kgGroup 0+Up to 13 kgGroup 1From 9 to 18 kgGroup 2From 15 to 25 kgGroup 3From 22 to 36 kg
Child seats that have been tested and ap- proved under the ECE R44 or ECE-R129 stand- ards bear the ECE-R44 or ECE-R129 test marks on the seat (the letter E in a circle with the test number below it).
Follow the manufacturer's instructions and ob- serve any statutory requirements when instal- ling and using child seats.
We recommend you to always include the manufacturer's Child Seat Instruction Manual together with the on-board documentation.
CUPRA recommends you use child seats from the Original Accessories Catalogue. These child seats have been designed and tested for use in our vehicles. You can find the right child seat for your model and age group at our deal- ers.

Child seats by approval category
Child seats may have the approval category of universal, semi-universal, vehicle specific (all according to the ECE-R44 standard) or i-Size (according to the ECE-R129 standard).
? 
Universal: child seats with universal approval can be installed in all vehicles. There is no need to consult any list of models. In the case of universal approval for ISOFIX, the child seat is additionally provided with a Top Tether belt.
? Semi-universal: semi-universal approval, in addition to the standard requirements of uni- versal approval, requires safety devices to lock the child seat, which require additional test- ing. Child seats with semi-universal approval include a list of vehicle models for which they can be installed.
? Vehicle-specific: vehicle-specific approval requires a dynamic test of the child seat for each vehicle model separately. Child seats with vehicle-specific approval also include a list of vehicle models for which they can be installed.
? i-Size: child seats with i-Size approval must meet the requirements prescribed in the ECE- R 129 standard in relation to installation and safety. Child seat manufacturers can tell you which seats have i-Size approval for this vehi- cle.

Warnings about fitting a child seat
Take the following general warnings into ac- count if you are going to fit a child seat. They are valid for all child seats regardless of their attachment system.
? 
Please read and follow the child seat manu- facturer's operating instructions.
? The child seat should preferably be fitted to the rear seat behind the front passenger seat so that the child can exit the vehicle on the pavement side.
? Set the height of the seat belt such that it adapts to the child seat naturally, without
twisting. The lowest position of the seat belt height regulator must be used with rear-facing child seats.
? To correctly use a child seat in the back, the front backrest must be adjusted so that there is no contact with the child seat in the back if it is rear facing. In the case of front facing restraint systems, the front backrest must be adjusted so that there is no contact with the child's feet.
? For a correct assembly of the child's seat on the rear seats, adjust or dismount the head- rest, in order to prevent contact with the seat.
? If a semi-universal type seat is to be installed, in which the method of attachment to the car is through the seat belt and support bracket,
it should never be installed in the central rear seat as the ground clearance is lower than in other places and the support bracket will not allow the seat to remain sufficiently stable.

Important information about the front pas- senger airbag
A sticker with important information about the passenger airbag is located on the passenger's sunshade blind and/or on the passenger side
door frame ››› Fig. 35.
Read and always observe the safety informa- tion included in the following chapters:
? Safety distance with respect to the passenger airbag ››› page 48.
? Objects between the passenger and the pas- senger side airbag ›››	in Front airbags on page 52.
The passenger side front airbag, when ena- bled, is a serious risk for a rear-facing child since the airbag can strike the seat with such force that it can cause serious or fatal injuries. Children up to 12 years old should always travel on the rear seat.
Therefore we strongly recommend that you transport children on the rear seats. This is the safest location in the vehicle. Alternatively, the front passenger airbag can be disabled with a
key-operated switch ››› page 52. When trans-
porting children, use a child seat suitable for the age and size of each child ››› page 57.

Attachment systems
Depending on the country, different attach- ment systems are used for safely installing child seats.

Attachment systems overview
? ISOFIX: ISOFIX is a standardised attachment system allowing quick and safe attachment of child seats in the vehicle. ISOFIX attachment establishes a rigid connection between the child seat and the car body.
The child seat has two rigid attachment clips, called connectors. These connectors are fit- ted into the ISOFIX attachment rings found between the seat cushion and the backrest of the vehicle's back seat (on the sides). ISO-
FIX attachment systems are used mainly in Eu- rope ››› page 60. If necessary, ISOFIX at-
tachment may have to be supplemented with a Top Tether belt or a support bracket.
? 
Automatic three-point seat belt. Whenever possible, it is preferable to attach the child seats with the ISOFIX system rather than at- taching them with an automatic three-point
seat belt ››› page 64.
Additional attachment:
? Top Tether: the Top Tether belt is guided over the back of the rear seat and attached to an anchor point with a hook. Anchor points are located at the back of the rear seat backrest on
the luggage compartment side ››› page 63.
The rings for retaining the Top Tether belt are marked with an anchor symbol.
? Support bracket: some child seats rest on the floor of the vehicle with a support bracket. The support bracket prevents the child seat from tipping forward in the event of impact. Child seats fitted with a support bracket should only be used in the passenger seat and side
rear seats ››› . For the assembly of this type
of seat you should also consult the list of ap- proved vehicles for this assembly, available in the instructions for child restraint systems.

Recommended systems for attaching child seats
CUPRA recommends attaching child seats as follows:
? Baby carriers or rear facing child seats: ISOFIX and support bracket or i-Size.
? Forward-facing child seats: ISOFIX and Top Tether.


59


Securing the child seat with the ISOFIX or i-Size system
The marking of ISOFIX or i-Size anchor points depends on the equipment and the country in question.
To understand the compatibility of the ISOFIX or i-Size systems in the vehicle, check the table below.

? IB: Seat suitable for installing an ISOFIX forward-facing group 2/3 booster seat as well as an i-size forward-facing child seat for children with a height of 100 to 150 cm.
? X: Position not suitable for ISOFIX or i-Size child restraint systems in this weight group or size class.


Securing the child seat with the ISOFIX or i-Size system











You must follow the child seat manufacturer's instructions.
The location of the ISOFIX or i-Size anchor points is indicated by a symbol ››› Fig. 37 ,
››› Fig. 381). In some vehicles, the rings are
secured to the seat frame and, in others, they are secured to the rear floor.
? If necessary, remove the protective caps from the ISOFIX or i-Size anchor points.
? Press the child seat onto the ISOFIX or iSize securing rings until it is heard to engage se-
curely ››› Fig. 39. If the child seat is equipped
with Top Tether anchor points, secure it to the correspondent ring ››› page 63. Follow the child seat manufacturer's instructions.
? Pull on both sides of the child seat to ensure that it is properly anchored.
Child seats with the ISOFIX or i-Size and Top Tether attachment system can be purchased from technical services.

62



Use of Top Tether on rear-facing child re- straints
Currently, there are very few rear-facing child restraints with Top Tether. The car seat manu- facturer's instructions for proper installation of the Top Tether should be read carefully and followed.

Locking the tether belt




Top Tether securing belts

Child seats with a Top Tether system are fitted with an additional belt for fastening to an an- chor point in the vehicle. This anchor point
is located on the rear of the rear seat back-
rest and of the front passenger seat backrest1) (identified with the symbol  ) and provides
better retention ››› Fig. 40, ››› Fig. 41.
The objective of this system is to reduce for- ward movements of the child seat in a head-on collision, to reduce the risk of injuries that may be caused to the child's head by impacting against any element of the inside of the vehi- cle.





1) Not available in all markets/versions.
63


? Slide the belt and secure it properly with the anchor on the rear seat backrest ››› Fig. 40 ,
››› Fig. 41.
? Tighten the belt securely according to the manufacturer's instructions.







? Follow the manufacturer's instructions to de- ploy the child seat Top Tether retaining belt
? Rear seats: position the belt under the head- rest (according to the instructions of the seat itself, lift or remove the headrest if necessary)
››› Fig. 42.
Passenger seat: pass the belt over the built-in headrest ››› Fig. 43.


Release the tether belt
? Loosen the belt according to the manufac- turer's instructions.
? Press the lock and release it from the anchor bracket.




Fitting a child seat using the seat belt

? Insert the latch plate into the seat's buckle until you hear the engagement click.






In case of emergency
Hazard warning lights











The hazard warning lights are used to draw the attention of other road users to your vehicle in emergencies.
If your vehicle is stationary:
1. 
Park the vehicle at a safe distance from road traffic.
2. Press the button to switch on the hazard warning lights ››› .
3. Apply the electronic parking brake.
4. Disconnect the drive system.
5. Follow the legal provisions of each coun- try (reflective vest, warning triangles, light beacon, etc.).
6. Always carry the key with you when leaving the vehicle.
All turn signals flash simultaneously when the hazard warning lights are switched on. The two turn signal turn signal lamps	and the turn signal lamp in the switch  will flash at the same time. The simultaneous hazard warning lights also work when the ignition is switched off.
While the hazard warning lights are on, you can signal a direction or lane change, e.g. during towing, by operating the turn signal lever. The hazard warning lights remain switched off dur- ing this time.

Emergency braking warning
If the vehicle brakes suddenly and continu- ously at a speed of more than 80 km/h (50 mph), the brake light flashes several times per second to warn the vehicles driving behind.
If you continue braking, the hazard warning lights will come on automatically when the


66




vehicle comes to a standstill. They switch off automatically when the vehicle starts to move again.

Behaviour in the event of an acci- dent or fire
Actions to take in the event of a fire or acci- dent
For your own safety and that of other passen- gers, the following points should be observed
in the order given ›››  :
? Disconnect the drive system.
? If possible, switch on the hazard warning lights ››› page 66.
? Follow the legal provisions of each country (reflective vest, warning triangles, light beacon, etc.).
? If necessary, get any people out of the haz- ard area and apply first aid.
? Notify the emergency services. Tell them that it is an electric vehicle.
? Wait at a safe distance from the scene of the accident for the emergency services to arrive.
? Inform the emergency services and persons involved in the accident that it is an electric vehicle.
? In case of fire, do not attempt to extinguish the fire yourself or remain near the vehicle.

Active bonnet









This vehicle has a pedestrian protection sys- tem whereby, in the event of a pedestrian be- ing hit by the vehicle in a speed range of ap- proximately 30 to 55 km/h (18 to 34 mph), the front bonnet is raised by a few centimetres to increase the space available to absorb the en- ergy of the head impact on the bonnet and to increase the distance to the rigid areas of the engine or structure.
The "Active bonnet" system is only able to acti- vate correctly if the bonnet has not previously been deformed due to external factors.
In some cases, the system may activate even
if there is no collision with a pedestrian. For ex- ample, the system may activate in the following situations:
? 
Head-on collision with objects or animals.
? Driving that bounces or bumps the vehicle on uneven terrain.
Special hinges lock the bonnet in the open position ››› Fig. 46, the airbag warning lamp
lights up and a warning is displayed on the in- strument cluster display until the system has been repaired.
If the active bonnet has been raised, the fol- lowing should be taken into account:
? Never try to close the bonnet by hand. Have the vehicle repaired immediately at a qualified specialist service. CUPRA recommends that you visit a CUPRA dealer.
? It is only permitted to continue driving if the vehicle is road safe.
? Do not drive faster than 80 km/h (50 mph).
? If necessary, adjust the position of the seat
››› page 38. Despite the active bonnet being
raised, unrestricted visibility through the wind- shield is necessary.




Information call, Assistance call and Emergency call service

The following voice services can be run by pressing the buttons ,	and	››› Fig. 47:
? Information call.
? Assistance call.
? Emergency call service.
A built-in control unit establishes the connec- tion.
When a voice service is activated, a connec- tion is established with a phone line.

Control lamp.
There is a control lamp on the control
››› Fig. 47 (arrow). It shows the following sta-
tuses:
? 
Off: the eCall service is not available.
? Flashes in red, approx. 20 seconds after switching on the ignition: the eCall service is deactivated.
? Lights up red: system failure. The eCall serv- ice is available with certain restrictions. CUPRA suggests going to a specialised workshop.
? Lights up green: the eCall service is availa- ble. The system is ready to work in the vehicle.
? Flashes green: There is an ongoing voice connection.

Assistance call
With the breakdown call you can directly re- quest specialised help in the event of a break- down.
Parallel to the voice call, some vehicle data is transmitted, e.g. your current location.

Information call
With an information call, a call is placed to CU- PRA S.A. customer care service.

Types of emergency call
? Public mandatory by law): emergency call made to the emergency services of the coun- try you are driving in, in the language of that
country. ››› page 71.
? Private: an emergency call that is made to a "CUPRA call centre", which offers improved customer service, such as service in the lan- guage selected in the infotainment system. At any time, the user can choose to cancel the
private emergency call in order to be attended by the country's emergency services.

Private emergency call
If the private emergency call service is availa- ble in the vehicle's service portfolio, the emer- gency call service is activated by default for a limited period of time.
? The emergency call service can be used to organise help as quickly as possible in an emergency situation.
? When the emergency call service is activa- ted, a connection is made to the CUPRA emer- gency call centre.
? If an emergency call is made manually or, in the event of an accident, when the airbag
or seatbelt pretensioner is triggered, the data relevant to the emergency call will be transmit- ted automatically, for example, the current lo-
cation of the vehicle ››› page 357.



69




? The telephone contact person communi- cates in the language set in the vehicle's Info- tainment system. If this language is not availa- ble at the location where the emergency call is currently being made, English will be used.
? Additional components such as emergency call microphone, an emergency loudspeaker and an integrated battery which is separate from the integrated power supply, are installed to ensure operation even after a serious acci- dent.
? The emergency call service can be deactiva- ted permanently by a qualified specialist. CU- PRA recommends that you contact an official CUPRA service or a SEAT official service.
? If the public emergency call system is avail- able in the vehicle, the private emergency call service can be deactivated via the web or app, or by preventing data transmission in
the Infotainment system, via the privacy mode
››› page 247.

If the integrated battery discharges or is de- fective, a message stating this is displayed on the instrument cluster display. Go to a special- ised workshop and ask for the battery to be replaced.

EDR data transmission ››› page 357
When an emergency call is made, the available data are transmitted to the CUPRA emergency call centre so that the necessary rescue meas- ures can be determined.
Vehicle location data is continuously overwrit- ten. This means that the vehicle is not subject to permanent monitoring.
The data related to the emergency call is only processed to ensure the correct operation of the emergency call system (eCall). The system will automatically delete the data related to the call a few hours after the call is activated.
The sent data includes:
? The vehicle's current position at the time the emergency call is activated.
? Vehicle identification number (VIN)
? Type of vehicle and type of drive.
? Type of activation (automatic or manual).
? Type of call.

? Estimated number of vehicle occupants.
? Language selected in the infotainment sys- tem.

eCall emergency call service, re- quired by law.
Depending on the equipment and the country, the vehicle may be fitted with an emergency call system. In some countries, the free public emergency call system is activated by default. The control element is located on the roof
console ››› Fig. 47.
With the emergency call, help can be organ- ised as quickly as possible in emergency situa- tions. A voice connection is established with
a public rescue coordination centre. The tele- phone contact person communicates in the language of the country in which the vehicle is located. In addition, any legally required data relevant to emergency calls is automatically transmitted to the public rescue control cen- tre, such as the vehicle's current location.
The required connection is made via a factory- installed control unit. Additional components such as an emergency call microphone, an emergency loudspeaker and an integrated bat- tery which is independent of the integrated power supply, are required to ensure operation even after a serious accident.

››› Fig. 52
1 High voltage can cause serious injury or even death. Never touch the battery poles with bare fingers, tools, jewellery or other metal objects.
2 The high-voltage battery contains hazard- ous liquid and solid substances. Emitted gases can cause severe burns and blind- ness. Suitable eye protection and protec- tive clothing must always be worn when working on the high voltage battery to prevent battery fluid coming into contact with the skin and eyes. If the battery fluid comes into contact with the skin or eyes, the affected areas should be rinsed with clean running water for at least 15 minutes, and then a doctor should be consulted im- mediately.
3 The high-voltage battery may burn. The high-voltage battery should never be ex- posed to fire, sparks or naked flame. The high voltage battery must always be han- dled with care to avoid damage and fluid leakages.
4 The high-voltage battery should always be kept out of the reach of children.
5 You will find further information and warn- ings in the usage instructions and work- shop documentation.
6 Incorrect handling of the high-voltage battery can cause serious injuries or death. Never disassemble the high voltage bat- tery or remove its cover.




7 Maintenance work on the high-voltage battery must only be performed by speci- alized personnel with the corresponding qualifications and training. Never modify the high-voltage battery. When the high- voltage battery is open, ensure it does not come into contact with water or other liquids. Liquids may cause short circuits, electrical shocks and burns.

Conservation of the high- voltage battery
Conservation instructions
Reliability and capacity of the high-voltage battery
In principle, lithium ion batteries are subject to ageing and wear and tear throughout their useful life due to their physical and chemical characteristics. Correct handling of the high- voltage battery makes an essential contribu- tion to keeping it in a reliable state in the
long term and to achieving high battery ca- pacity and range. Therefore, it is extremely important to respect the following conserva- tion instructions for the high voltage battery. These maintenance instructions are essential for maintaining the vehicle's value over time.
Please also observe the applicable CUPRA war- ranty conditions for the high-voltage battery.

Conservation instructions
CUPRA recommends the following conserva- tion instructions:
? When using the vehicle regularly, do not charge the battery to 100%. Set a maximum charge limit of 80% in the charging settings.
? As much as possible avoid fully discharging the high-voltage battery, such as by leaving the vehicle parked for a prolonged time with a low load level. The charge level must not drop be-
low 20% for long periods of time ›››  .
? Before long trips, charge the high voltage battery to 100 %. Set the departure time in the
infotainment system ››› page 86 and start
driving as soon as possible.
? To prolong the life of the high-voltage bat- tery, use DC direct current fast charging as lit- tle as possible.
? As far as possible, keep the "Battery Care Mode" function active in the General Charg-
ing Settings ››› page 87 menu.
Vehicle parking times
? If there is a frost, do not park the vehicle for several hours with a charge level of lower than
40% ›››  .
? If the vehicle is to be parked for an extended period of time, the battery charge level should be between 40% and 70%.
? 
Avoid exposing the vehicle to temperatures below -30 °C as far as possible, or to direct sunlight at high temperatures.
? To improve comfort and performance, make sparse use of the stationary air conditioning (depending on the equipment), particularly in
temperatures lower than -15 °C ››› page 146.

Charging the high-voltage battery
Introduction

Check that the drive system is deactivated and that the charging cable and infrastructure are in a perfect state of repair.

Types of charging
The following charging types are possible for the vehicle:
? Charging with alternating current (AC) at a public or home charging station ››› page 78:
Charging at high power. The maximum achiev- able charging power depends on the charging station and charging cable that is used and the performance of the vehicle's charger.
? Charging with alternating current (AC) at a household socket ››› page 78:
The electrical installation of the house must have been checked and be in perfect working
order ›››  . Due to the large capacity of the
battery and the low power of this method, a full charge will take more than 20 hours (8 hours, depending on the market).
? Charging with direct current (DC) at a fast charging station ››› page 79:

This is the most powerful type of charge. The charging time decreases significantly. Please note the information on charging frequently
with direct current (DC) ›››  .
Protection against current leakage
The vehicle is fitted with a direct current (DC) leakage protection device. This prevents any current leakage that may occur during charg- ing from reaching the house's electrically in- stallation through the charging cable.

You can use up to 3 different departure times and activate or deactivate them at any time by re-entering the schedule.

Preferred times
Allows you to configure up to four time slots in which the vehicle will prioritise charging. This is ideal if you are on a variable cost energy tariff, because you can charge when the cost of en- ergy is low.
Edit the start and finish times of the time slots by clicking on the time slot and activate the preferred charging times by ticking the check- box.

Charging levels
? Minimum charging level: The minimum charging level sets the minimum state of charge for a saved schedule. This function can be used to guarantee a minimum range.


1) Subject to the conditions of the charging point operator.
86




1. Open in the Charging menu ››› page 85
2. Set the minimum charging level in the schedule.
After connecting the electricity, first of all the vehicle charges up to the battery's minimum charging level. The preferred times or a de- parture time, for programmed charging, will only be taken into account once this limit is reached.
? Maximum charging level 8 : Normally, if you use the vehicle regularly, it is not necessary
to fully charge the high-voltage battery. The maximum charging level limits the battery's maximum state of charge.
1. Drag the touch slider to the desired value in the infotainment system's scheduling set-
tings ››› page 85.
The maximum charging level can also be adapted during charging.


Recommendations for charging with alter- nating current (AC)
Use in everyday life:
? A long range is not necessary.
- Maximum battery charging level: 80% maximum.
- Minimum battery charging level: 20% as a minimum if the outside temperature is mild or warm, or 40% if it is cool or cold.
Long journeys:
? A long range is necessary.
- Maximum battery charging level: 100%.
- Minimum battery charging level: 20% as a minimum if the outside temperature is mild or warm, or 40% if it is cool or cold.



Advanced options
? Reducing the alternating current (AC) charg- ing power: This reduces the charging current to between 6 and 8 amps to avoid overloading the household power network.
? Unlocking the alternating current (AC) cable: Once the charging process is complete, the connector is automatically unlocked.

Air conditioning
The vehicle interior can be heated or cooled for the configured departure time (depending on the equipment).
Set the desired temperature in the Stationary air conditioning ››› page 146 menu.
? Select the Charge and air conditioning prior to departure function from the drop- down list of charging modes.


Configuration in the Settings menu

1. Open the main Charging menu.
2. Push the	4 ››› Fig. 63 button.
Settings in unknown locations
? Reduce the AC charging power: the charg- ing current is reduced to 6 or 8 amps depend- ing on the country. With this setting you can reduce mains overload when charging at a socket.
? Release the AC power cable: After the charg- ing process is complete, the connector relea- ses automatically.


87




Battery Care Mode function
Keeping the battery charged to levels close to 100% while the vehicle is parked is not recom- mended to ensure good battery health (partic- ularly in hot climates).
This function automatically configures the maximum charge level according to the am- bient temperature by setting it to 80% when the temperature is above 5ºC and 90% if the temperature is below 0ºC. If the temperature drops from 5 to 0ºC, it is limited to 90% at 0ºC and below. If the temperature rises from 0ºC to 5ºC, it is limited to 80% from 5ºC and higher.
When leaving the vehicle parked in very hot weather (e.g. in the sun in summer) with a high state of charge, to prevent battery drain the Battery Care Mode will activate battery cooling to cool the battery and keep it at a state of charge of around 80%.
If you need to charge the battery to 100%, you do not need to deactivate the function. Set the charge level to 100% and the charg- ing limit will automatically reactivate during the next charge.






Plug & Charge function
Plug & Charge simplifies the payment process at charging stations without the need for cards or phones.
Upon arrival at a public charging station, the vehicle is authenticated and the charging process starts automatically as soon as the charging cable is plugged in. The function de- pends on the equipment and the country.
Prerequisites:
? A subscription has been arranged with an electro-mobility service provider (MSP) com- patible with Plug & Charge and the contract has been installed in the vehicle via the My CU- PRA Appapp. In order to change the contract installation, the main user must be logged into the vehicle.
? The charging station supports the Plug & Charge function in accordance with ISO 15118.
? Before charging with Plug & Charge, "Pri- vacy" mode must be deactivated. The vehicle has active data transmission and localization
››› page 247.
? Plug & Charge has been activated in the Info- tainment system.



Once the contract has been installed in the vehicle, it is active for all users (primary and ad- ditional). All users can deactivate the function, but only the primary user can reactivate it.
To delete the functionality and all Plug & Charge data, you must reset the vehicle to fac-
tory settings ››› page 260.

Charging with a home en- ergy management system
Bidirectional Charging
Bi-directional charging allows power to be transferred from your vehicle's battery to your home, and vice-versa.
This requires a home energy management sys- tem and a compatible charger.

Prerequisites
? Vehicle with 77 kWh net battery capacity.
? Compatible home energy management sys- tem (HEMS) and bi-directional DC charging station.
? A charging schedule must be created in the infotainment system (Schedule tab).

Functionality
Once the schedule has been created, choose between the Bi-directional charging (charge and discharge) or Discharge (discharge only) mode in the drop-down charge mode selector.


To limit the energy transferred, set the battery charge levels in the Infotainment system. For technical reasons, the lower and upper battery charge levels are limited to 20% and 80% re- spectively.
The hours defined in the schedule and the ve- hicle's preferred hours will not apply to bi-di- rectional charging, they will be governed by the schedules of the home e-manager.
In addition, the home energy management system can reuse electricity from the high- voltage battery in the event of a power failure or to power a home without a connection to the electrical grid.




Selecting the charging mode
1. Press the drop-down list of charging modes and select Bi-directional Charging

Depending on the equipment, the vehicle may have the Keyless Access system. This is a key- less locking and starting system that can un- lock and lock the vehicle without actively using its key. For this, it is only necessary that there
is a valid vehicle key in the detection area cor- responding to the attempted access to the ve- hicle.

Configuring the Keyless Access system
The behaviour of the Keyless Access system can be adjusted in the Vehicle settings menu
of the Infotainment system ››› page 33.
If the Keyless Access function is disabled, its operation is limited.

Unlocks the vehicle.
? Touch the sensor surface on the inside of the handle A . All turn signals flash twice.
If selective opening is fitted, touching the sen- sor's surface twice unlocks the entire vehicle.
If the vehicle is not unlocked for an extended period, the function is deactivated. The func- tion will reactivate the next time that the vehi- cle is unlocked with the remote control.

Locks the vehicle.
? Park the vehicle.
? Touch the sensor surface B ››› Fig. 69 on the outside of the door handle. All turn signals flash once.
To check that the vehicle is properly locked, the unlocking function is deactivated for a few seconds.

Vehicle locking when walking away
The vehicle may lock automatically when when you walk away from it. The following conditions must be met simultaneously:
? The function is active in the infotainment system.
? All vehicle keys are outside the locking area.
All turn signals flash once when automatic locking has been performed successfully.
Automatic locking will not occur if there is an- other vehicle key in the vehicle.

One-time deactivation of automatic locking:
1. Press and hold the button for more than 2 seconds with the door open.
Automatic locking will not be available until the next time the vehicle is intentionally locked.
The vehicle is only locked if all doors and the rear lid are closed. If this option has been activated in the vehicle settings, an audible warning may be heard to indicate that a door is open.
In vehicles fitted with the "Safe" security sys- tem, when the vehicle is locked when walking away from the vehicle, it is locked without the "Safe"function. This is indicated to the user by an audible signal. The vehicle's "Safe" system is only activated after intentionally locking using the door handle or contact key.
If the key is in the detection zone around the vehicle for a prolonged period of time, the op- tions for locking when you walk away from the vehicle and unlocking when you approach it may work in a limited manner.

Unlocking the vehicle on approach
The vehicle can be unlocked by approaching it. For this to work, the function must be activated in the infotainment system and the vehicle key must be in the vehicle's approach area.
? The vehicle is unlocked when the vehicle key is detected nearby ››› Fig. 68. All turn signals flash twice.
If the vehicle is not unlocked for an exten- ded period of time, the "Unlock vehicle when approaching it" function is deactivated. This
function reactivates when the vehicle is locked again.
When activating the unlocking function for certain doors in the central locking settings in the infotainment system, it is possible that the "Unlock vehicle when approaching" function will only work to a limited extent.

Unlocking the rear lid
When the vehicle is locked and the "Keyless Access" function is active, the rear lid auto- matically unlocks when it is opened if there is a vehicle key in its proximity zone. The rear lid locks again after closing.
If the central locking of all doors and the un- lock when approaching function in "Keyless Access" are active, the vehicle remains un- locked after the rear lid is closed. The vehicle does not lock automatically

Temporarily deactivating the Keyless Access system
The "Keyless Access" system's unlocking func- tion can be temporarily deactivated:
? Lock the vehicle using the button on the vehicle key.
? Within 5 seconds, touch the sensor on the outside of the door handle once ››› Fig. 69
 B . Do not grip the handle while doing so. This temporarily deactivates the Keyless Access sys- tem.
? Check that it is deactivated by pulling on the door handle after at least 10 seconds. It should not be possible to open the door.
The next time, the vehicle can only be un- locked electronically with the vehicle key. After being unlocked the next time, the Keyless Ac-
cess system will be activated again ››› .
Permanently disabling the Keyless Access system
The Keyless Access system can also be perma- nently deactivated in the infotainment system
››› .

Self-locking system to prevent involuntary unlocking
It is an anti-theft system and prevents the un- intentional unlocking of the vehicle. If the vehi- cle is unlocked and none of the doors (includ- ing the boot) are opened within 45 seconds, it re-locks automatically.


Central locking
Introduction
Central locking functions correctly when all the doors and the rear lid are correctly shut. If the driver's door is open, the vehicle cannot be locked with the key.











Description
Central locking allows all doors, the rear lid and the tank flap to be centrally locked and unlocked:


Automatic locking (Auto Lock)
The vehicle locks automatically at over a speed of approx. 15 km/h (9 mph). When the vehicle is locked, the control lamp of the central locking button lights up yellow.

Automatic unlocking (Auto Unlock)
If one of the following conditions is met, all doors and the rear lid are unlocked automati- cally:


97




? The electronic parking brake is engaged and the ignition is switched off.
? EITHER: the inside door handle has been pulled. This applies when driving at under 15 km/h (9 mph).
? OR: in the event of an accident and an airbag has been triggered ››› page 100.
Automatic unlocking allows third parties to ac- cess the interior of the vehicle to provide assis- tance if necessary.

Turn signals
The turn signals will flash twice when the vehi- cle is unlocked and once when the vehicle is locked.
If it does not flash, this indicates that one of the doors, the rear lid or the bonnet is not closed correctly.

Central locking settings
Central locking settings can be changed in the Infotainment system.
Selective unlocking of the doors
? Press the function button	> Vehicle > Ex- terior > Opening and closing > Central lock- ing.
You can decide whether unlocking unlocks all doors, one door or one side of the vehicle. One locking action operates all vehicle doors regardless of the selected unlocking mode.

In all the options, the charging socket flap is also unlocked.
With the One door setting, the driver's door is unlocked when:
? The button on the remote control key is pressed once.
? OR: It is unlocked once using the key shaft.
? OR: It is unlocked once via Keyless on the driver's door handle.
? OR: It is unlocked by approaching the driv- er's door. Automatic unlocking does not occur when approaching the passenger door.
With the One-side setting, only one side of the vehicle is unlocked when:
? The button on the remote control key is pressed once.
? OR: It is unlocked once using the key shaft.
? OR: It is unlocked once via Keyless Access on the driver's door handle. If unlocked at the passenger door, only the passenger side is un- locked.

Depending on the equipment, before lock- ing the vehicle temporarily deactivate interior monitoring and the anti-tow system in the Ve- hicle settings menu of the infotainment sys-
tem ››› page 101.
When the "Safe" security system is deactiva- ted, the following needs to be taken into ac- count:
? The vehicle can be unlocked and opened from the inside using an door handle.
? The anti-theft alarm is active ››› page 101.
? The interior monitoring system and the anti- tow system are disabled ››› page 101.




Troubleshooting
The control lamp remains on
The red LED on the driver's door flashes at short intervals and then stays on. There is a fault in the locking system.
? Contact a specialised workshop. CUPRA rec- ommends visiting a CUPRA dealership for this purpose.

The turn signals do not flash
If the turn signals do not flash as a confirma- tion when the vehicle is locked:
? At least one door or the rear lid are not closed or
? The bonnet is not closed.

The vehicle locks automatically
If one of the following conditions is met, the vehicle re-locks automatically after approx. 45 seconds.
? 
The vehicle has been unlocked, but none of the doors or the rear lid have been opened.

What happens when locking the vehicle with a second key
They key inside the vehicle is blocked and can- not be used to switch on the drive system as soon as the vehicle is locked from the outside with a second key. To activate the key inside the vehicle to allow it to switch on the drive system, press its button.

Unlocking and locking the vehicle after an airbag deployment

Anti-theft alarm
Description
Depending on the equipment, the vehicle may be fitted with an anti-theft alarm.
The anti-theft alarm monitors the doors, front bonnet and rear lid.
The anti-theft alarm system activates automat- ically when the vehicle is locked.
If the vehicle is not opened electronically with a valid key, the alarm triggers and emits audio and light signals for a maximum of approx. 5 minutes.

When is the anti-theft alarm triggered?
? If a mechanically unlocked door is opened with the vehicle key.
? If the front bonnet is opened.
? If the rear lid is opened.
? If an invalid vehicle key is used.
? 
If there are movements inside the ve- hicle (in vehicles with interior monitoring
››› page 101).
? If the vehicle is lifted or towed (for vehicles with an anti-tow system ››› page 101.
? If the vehicle is transported on a ferry or by rail (in vehicles with an anti-tow system or inte-
rior monitoring ››› page 101).
? If the 12-volt battery is disconnected.
? If the window is broken.
? When a trailer connected to the theft alarm system is unhitched.

Switching off the alarm
? Unlock the vehicle with the vehicle key un- locking button .
? Grip the door handle.
? Switch the ignition on. Please note: to turn on the ignition, place the vehicle key in the area provided for it to perform an emergency
start ››› page 157.



Interior monitoring and anti-tow system
If movement is detected in the vehicle interior while the vehicle is locked, the interior moni- toring triggers the alarm.
If it detects that the vehicle is being lifted, the anti-tow system triggers the alarm.

Switching on the interior monitoring and the anti-tow systems
? Lock the vehicle. When the anti-theft alarm is activated, the interior monitoring and the anti-tow system are as well.
Depending on the equipment, the use of a partition net can affect the operation of the interior monitoring system.

Temporarily switching off the interior moni- toring and anti-tow systems
Interior monitoring and the anti-tow system can also be temporarily switched off in the in- fotainment system.	> Vehicle > Exterior > Opening/Closing > Central locking > Interior
monitoring ››› page 33. The interior moni-
toring and anti-tow system remain deactivated until the next time the vehicle is locked.

Interior monitoring and the anti-tow system can also be switched off in the departure menu. To do this, the ignition must be switched
off ››› page 154.


101




To avoid false alarms, deactivate interior moni- toring and the anti-tow system in the following situations:
? When people or animals remain inside the vehicle.
? When the vehicle is to be loaded onto another means of transport, transported or towed.
? When the vehicle is to be left in a car wash or is to be parked in a double-decker garage.

Risk of false interior monitoring alarms
The interior monitoring system will only op- erate correctly if the vehicle is completely locked. Please bear in mind all legal provisions. The following situations may cause a false alarm:
? If one or more windows are partially or com- pletely open.
? If light objects are left inside the vehicle, e.g. loose paper or items hanging from the interior mirror.
? If the vibrate function of a mobile left inside the vehicle is activated.





Doors
Introduction
The doors and rear lid can be locked manually and partially opened, for example if the key or the central locking is damaged.






Door opening
The door opening/closing system is electronic.

Opening doors from the outside
The exterior door handles have a surface on the interior to act as a push button.

The key blade is inserted by pointing the grip towards the rear door (the entire key blade en- ters the cylinder in this position).

Special characteristics
? The anti-theft alarm will remain active when vehicles are unlocked. However, the alarm will
not be triggered ››› page 101.
? After the driver's door is opened, you have 15 seconds to switch on the ignition. Once this time has elapsed, the alarm is triggered.
? Switch the ignition on. The electronic immo- bilizer recognises a valid vehicle key and deac- tivates the anti-theft alarm system.

Emergency lock of doors without lock cylinders









If the central locking system fails or the vehi- cle's battery goes flat, doors with no lock cylin- der will have to be locked separately.
The emergency lock is located on the front of the front passenger's door and the rear doors. It can only be seen if the door is open.

? If necessary, remove the rubber seal from the front of the door ››› Fig. 75.
? Insert the key in the inside slot and turn it to the right as far as it will go (if the door is on the right side) or to the left (if the door is on the left side).
? Replace the cap.

Once the door has been closed it can no lon- ger be opened from the outside. Pull the inte- rior door handle once to unlock and open the door.

Side lights
When the side light  is switched on, the side lights in both headlights, certain areas of the rear light clusters, the number plate light and the button lights on the instrument cluster turn on. The automatic dipped beam activates as of a speed of approx. 10 km/h (6 mph).

Additionally, when the tailgate is opened, the tailgate mounted parts of the rear light clus- ters and the number plate lamp will switch off. Those parts of the light clusters which are not mounted on the rear lid will light up with in- creased brightness to improve the visibility of the vehicle.

Automatic dipped beam headlight control

When the automatic dipped beam is switched on, the vehicle's lighting and the lighting of the instruments and controls turn on and off under the following conditions:


120




? The light sensor has detected darkness.
? The wiper has been on for some time.
When the lights are on, the control lamp lights up in green.
The automatic dipped beam is only an auxili- ary function and cannot always identify all sit- uations that may arise during driving with suffi- cient precision.
If the vehicle has the appropriate equipment, the vehicle settings menu of the infotainment system can be used to set the moment that the dipped beam automatically switches on
››› page 33.
Cornering light function
The cornering light is an additional function to the dipped beam to improve lighting of the
side of the road when cornering at low speeds.
When the dipped beam is on, a static corner- ing light comes on when driving at speeds be- low about 40 km/h (25 mph) or on very tight bends.
? If the steering wheel is turned or the turn sig- nal is switched on, the corresponding fog light comes on progressively. Once the turn has been made, the cornering light progressively turns off.
? When engaging reverse gear, both fog lights turn on at the same time.

Daytime running lights
Daytime running lights can increase the ve- hicle's visibility when driving in daylight and they turn on automatically when the ignition is switched on (if brightness is detected).

Main beam assist (Light Assist)
The main beam assist automatically prevents glare from vehicles moving in the opposite di- rection or ahead in the same direction. In addi- tion, the main beam assist detects illuminated areas and disconnects the main beam head- light when passing, e.g. by populated areas.
Within its limitations, the assist system auto- matically connects or disconnects the main beam headlight depending on the environ- mental and traffic conditions, as well as the
speed ›››  .
Advanced main beam assistant (LED Matrix)
The advanced main beam assistant provides maximum illumination of the road and road- side. At the same time, it avoids dazzling vehi- cles ahead or oncoming traffic.
The system uses a camera to detect other road users and deactivates certain areas within the light distribution in a specific manner. If the system cannot avoid dazzling other road users, the main beam is switched off completely.

The advanced main beam assistant normally recognizes illuminated areas such as cities and deactivates the main beam while driving through them.
Within the limits of the system, the assistant automatically switches the main beam on or off depending on the ambient conditions, traf- fic conditions and driving speed.
The advanced main beam assistant can be switched on or off in the vehicle settings in the Infotainment System.

    Switching on the main beam assist or advanced main beam assist (Matrix LED)
? Switch on the ignition and select mode on the headlight control ››› Fig. 93.
? From the neutral position, press the turn sig- nal and main beam headlights lever forwards
››› Fig. 94 3 .
When the main beam assist is switched on, the control lamp  on the instrument cluster screen turns on. When the main beam is on, the blue main beam control lamp  on the instrument cluster switches on.


123




Switching off the main beam assistant or ad- vanced main beam assistant (LED Matrix)
? Switching off mode	on the headlight control ››› Fig. 93.
? EITHER: if main beam assist is on, pull the turn signal light and main beam headlights
lever back ››› Fig. 94 4 .
? OR: if the main beam assistant is on, but the main beam does not turn on, press the turn signal and main beam lever forwards to turn the main beam on manually. Pull the turn sig- nal and main beam lever back to switch off the main beam manually, if necessary.
? OR: switch off the ignition.

System limitations
In the following cases, the main beam head- light must be switched off manually because the main beam assist will not disconnect it on time or disconnect it at all:
? On insufficiently lit roads with highly reflec- tive signs.
? If road users are insufficiently lit up, e.g. pe- destrians or cyclists.
? On closed curves, when the traffic in the opposite direction is partially hidden, on pro- nounced slopes or inclinations.
? On roads with traffic in the opposite direction and with a central reservation barrier where the driver can see over it e.g. lorry drivers.
? In case of fog, snow or heavy rainfall.
? 
In case of swirling dust or sand.
? If the windscreen is damaged in the camera's field of vision.
? If the camera's field of vision is misted up, dirty or covered by a sticker, snow or ice.
? If the camera is damaged or if the power supply has been cut off.







"Coming home" and "Leav-
ing home" function (exterior ori- entation lighting)
The "Coming home" and "Leaving home" function lights up the vehicle's immediate sur- roundings when getting into and out of it in the dark.
This light is automatically controlled by a light sensor.


124




Includes parts of the headlamps, rear light clusters, welcome light and door handle lights.

Turning on the "Leaving home" light
? Unlocks the vehicle (if the automatic dipped beam function	is switched on and the light sensor detects darkness).

? It turns off automatically once the lights off delay time has elapsed.
? OR: lock the vehicle.
? OR: press the light control as many times as necessary until the instrument cluster displays the setting .
? OR: switch on the ignition.

Turning on the "Coming home" light
? Switch the ignition off.
The "Coming home" light comes on if the au- tomatic headlight control	is switched on and the light sensor detects darkness.
The lights-off delay countdown starts when the last door or rear lid of the vehicle is closed.

Turning off the "Coming home" light
? It switches off automatically after the set lights-off delay time has elapsed.
? EITHER: it is automatically deactivated if, 30 seconds after the function has been activated, any vehicle door or the rear lid is still open.
? 
OR: press the light control as many times as necessary until the instrument cluster displays the setting .
? OR: switch on the ignition.

"Coming home" and "Leaving home" set- tings

"Leaving Home" function is switched on or off.

Light on the door handles
The light in the door handles is lighting located inside the exterior door handles which is acti- vated or deactivated if the light control is in position	and either the "Coming home" or "Leaving home" function is switched on or off.

 Dynamic headlight range control
The headlight range is automatically adjusted according to the vehicle load status when they are switched on.




Driving abroad
The light beam of the dipped beam lights is asymmetric: the side of the road on which you are driving is lit more intensely.
When a car that is manufactured in a country that drives on the right travels to a country that drives on the left (or vice versa), it is normally necessary to cover part of the headlight bulbs with stickers or to change the adjustment of the headlights to avoid dazzling other drivers.
In such cases, the regulations specify certain light values that must be complied with for designated points of the light distribution. This is known as "Tourist light".
The light distribution of the headlights allows the specific "tourist light" values to be met without the need for stickers or changes being made to the settings.

The rain sensor controls the frequency of the windscreen wiper intervals, depending on the
amount of rain ›››  .

Abnormal operation of the rain and light sensor
The possible causes of anomalies and errone- ous interpretations in the sensitive surface area
››› Fig. 98 of the rain sensor are, among oth-
ers:
? Damaged wipers: a film of water on the damaged blades may lengthen the activation time, reduce the washing intervals or result in a fast and continuous wipe.
? Insects: the impact of insects may cause the wiper to activate.
? Salt on the road: in winter, salt spread on the roads may cause an excessively long wipe when the windscreen is almost dry.
? Dirt: dry dust, wax, coating on glass (Lotus effect) or traces of detergent (car wash) may reduce the effectiveness of the rain sensor or make it react more slowly, later or not at all. Regularly clean the sensitive surface of the rain
sensor ››› Fig. 98 (arrow) and check for possi-
ble damage to the wiper blades.
? Windscreen crack: the impact of a stone will trigger a single wipe cycle with the rain sensor on. The rain sensor then detects the reduction of the sensor surface and adjusts itself. The behaviour of the sensor may vary depending on the size of the stone impact.





Troubleshooting

Windscreen washer fluid level too low
The control lamp lights up in yellow. Refill the washer fluid reservoir at the next opportunity
››› page 326.

Windscreen siper fault
The control lamp lights up in yellow. The wiper does not work.

The wiper does not switch on automatically in the event of rain, although the rain and light sensor is activated.
? Turn off the ignition and turn it on again.
? If the fault continues, consult a specialised workshop.

Mirrors
General safety instructions
The exterior and interior mirrors allow the driver to observe vehicles driving behind and adapt his or her driving behaviour accordingly.
For safe driving, it is important for the driver to adjust the exterior mirrors and interior mirror correctly before setting off.
When looking through the exterior mirrors and the interior mirror, it is not possible to see the entire area behind and to the sides of the vehi- cle. These areas outside the field of view are known as the blind spot. Other road users and objects may be in the blind spot.





130







Interior mirror
Interior mirror with automatic anti-dazzle function
When the ignition is switched on, the sensors in the mirror measure the light falling on it from behind and in front.
The interior mirror automatically darkens based on the measured values.
If the light falling onto the sensors is blocked or interrupted, e.g. by a sunshade blind or hang- ing objects, the automatic anti-dazzle interior mirror does not work or does not work prop- erly. Similarly, the use of portable navigation devices attached to the windscreen or close to the automatic anti-dazzle interior mirror can
affect the operation of the sensors ›››  .
The automatic anti-dazzle function is deacti- vated in certain situations, e.g. when reverse gear is engaged.











Adjusting the exterior mirrors

Air conditioning
Heating, ventilation and cooling
Introduction
Depending on the vehicle equipment, the air conditioning systems can be:
? Climatronic of 1 zone: heats, ventilates, cools and dehumidifies the passenger com- partment considering it as a single air condi- tioning area.
? The 3-zone climatronic: heats, ventilates, cools and dehumidifies the passenger com- partment considering it as 3 independent air conditioning areas (driver, front passenger and rear seats).

The air conditioning can be switched on by tapping any button in the air conditioning menu directly related to the air conditioning (for example temperatures,	,	, etc.).
The use of certain functions that are not di- rectly related to the operation of the air con- ditioning, such as the heated rear window for example, will not result in the air conditioning being switched on immediately.

Optimal air conditioning performance is ach- ieved when the vehicle interior is closed. If a great deal of heat accumulates in the interior, ventilating it can accelerate the cooling proc- ess.
Some functions and menu tabs depend on the equipment.

Operating the air conditioning with voice commands
Depending on the equipment, some of the air conditioning functions can be operated by
voice control ››› page 263.
Passenger recognition function
The passenger recognition function turns down the air conditioning in these areas if no occupation is detected in them, with the aim of reducing the vehicle's energy consumption.
When the drive system is on, the vehicle rec- ognises whether a person is sitting in a seat in the vehicle with a seatbelt fastened.
The turning down of the air conditioning is in- dicated as follows:
? Front passenger area: on the front passenger temperature setting, which will display ECO in- stead of the selected temperature.
? Rear area: On the rear temperature setting, where ECO will be displayed instead of the se- lected temperature. This turning down of the air conditioning will also be displayed on the control located in the rear area.

Dust and pollen filter
The dust and pollen filter with its activated charcoal cartridge serves as a barrier against impurities in the air taken into the vehicle inte- rior.
The dust and pollen filter must be changed regularly so that air conditioner performance is not adversely affected.
If the filter loses efficiency prematurely due to use in areas with very high levels of air
pollution, the filter must be changed more fre- quently than stated in the Service Schedule.

    or	The concentration of CO2 in the air in the vehicle interior is too high
The control lamp lights up red or yellow.
The following message may be displayed on the instrument cluster display: Health risk! High CO2 concentration. Open the windows! or Health hazard! CO2 very high. Open all the windows now!.
? Open all windows immediately.
? Have the system checked by a specialised workshop.

   The air conditioning does not work or the CO2 concentration cannot be measured
The control lamp lights up in yellow.


The following message may be displayed on the instrument cluster display: The air condi- tioning is not working properly. Go to the workshop.
? Have the system checked by a specialised workshop.

The cooling system cannot be switched on or its operation is limited
The  cooling mode operates when the driv- er's seat is occupied.
? Switch on the fan.
? Check the air conditioning's fuse
››› page 315.
? Change the active combined filter
››› page 344.
? If the fault continues, consult a specialised workshop.

Change the temperature unit (Climatronic)
The temperature display can be changed from Celsius to Fahrenheit on the Infotainment Sys- tem display using the function button > Set- tings > Units.

Water or water vapour under the vehicle
If the humidity and temperature outside the vehicle are high, condensation can drip off the evaporator in the cooling system and form a pool underneath the vehicle. This is normal and does not indicate a leak!


145




When the outside humidity is high and the am- bient temperature is low, condensation water may evaporate when the stationary air condi- tioning is operating. In this case, steam may come out from under the vehicle. This does not mean that the vehicle has any damage.

Stationary air condition- ing
Introduction
With the stationary air conditioning you can cool, ventilate and heat the vehicle interior while the vehicle is parked. In winter, you can also demist the windscreen and leave it free of ice and snow (if the layer is thin).
The stationary air conditioning is powered through a socket or the vehicle's high voltage battery. The stationary air conditioning can
be programmed and controlled in the infotain- ment system and by using the My CUPRA App, thanks to the CUPRA CONNECT Gen4 tech- nology.
You can find information about the app, its availability and the necessary requirements for its use, as well as compatible terminals, on the
Internet ››› page 243.






Managing the stationary air condi- tioning
The stationary air conditioning only works if the high voltage battery is sufficiently charged.
The stationary air conditioning can be used without the charging connector being plugged in. When the charging connector is not plug- ged in, the stationary air conditioning receives the necessary electrical power from the high- voltage battery.

Immediately air condition the parked vehicle (only if the driver is inside the vehicle)
? Switch the ignition off.
? Press in the Infotainment system's depar- ture menu ››› page 36.
The vehicle will be air-conditioned for approx. 30 minutes. The function switches off auto- matically. For this to work, the drive system should not be switched on.
The vehicle can also be air-conditioned before a desired departure time ››› page 147.

Immediately air condition a parked vehicle (only if the driver is not in the vehicle)
? Press the immediate on icon  in the Info- tainment system without turning on the vehi- cle's ignition.

Setting the desired temperature

? EITHER: Press the immediate on/off icon in the infotainment system (while the vehicle is switched off). It is only possible to switch it off if the stationary air conditioning was switched on using this button.
? EITHER: Press the air conditioning off button in the Air conditioning menu of the infotain- ment system (while the vehicle is off).

The stationary air conditioning switches off automatically
? After approx. 30 minutes if the vehicle is air- conditioned by "Air condition now" with the ignition switched off.
? After approx. 15 minutes if the drive system has not been switched on by one hour after the scheduled departure time.
? When the state of charge of the high voltage battery drops excessively.



Programming the stationary air conditioning
The stationary air conditioning can be pro- grammed in the Infotainment system for a scheduled departure time. You can set the de- sired temperature of the vehicle interior for the vehicle's planned departure time.
Based on the desired temperature, the vehicle calculates the time that the stationary air con- ditioning needs to be switched on to reach this temperature by the departure time. The maxi- mum pre-operation time of the stationary air conditioning is approx. 30 minutes before the departure time.

Air conditioning the vehicle for departure
? Open the Stationary air conditioning menu.
? Press  Departure to open the timer menu.
? Set the scheduled departure time.
? Activate the timer using the checkbox. The earliest scheduled departure time is dis-
played in the infotainment system's departure menu, and can be switched on and off there
››› page 36.
Stationary air conditioning with additional electrical comfort consumers
If air conditioning for departure is to be used, the electrical comfort consumers, such as seat heating, steering wheel heating or the heated rear window, can also be switched on automat-

ically before the departure time. The electri- cal comfort consumers depend on the equip- ment. They are only activated in low tempera- ture conditions.
To enable the use of these consumers:
? Open the Stationary air conditioning menu.
? Tap  Air conditioning.
? Select the seats whose comfort consumers should be connected along with the station- ary air conditioning. Only these seats will be heated before the departure time.
? To turn on the window heating before the departure time, activate the Automatic win- dow heating function
The maximum pre-operation time of the elec- trical comfort consumers is approx. 10 minutes before the departure time.
If the air conditioning is switched on imme- diately, the electrical comfort consumers are also activated.

Air conditioning the vehicle during high- voltage charging
If the vehicle's high-voltage battery is to be charged with alternating current (AC) or di- rect current (DC), the vehicle can be air con- ditioned before the scheduled departure time. This can be set in the infotainment system, un-
der charging settings ››› page 86.

Driving
Driving indications
Pedals
? Make sure that you can always press the ped- als without any problems.
? Ensure that the pedals can return unimpaired to their initial positions.
? Ensure that the floor mats are securely fas- tened during the trip and do not obstruct the
pedals ›››  .
Only use floor mats which leave the pedals clear and which are secured to prevent them from slipping. You can obtain suitable floor mats from a specialised dealership. Fasteners for floor mats are fitted in the footwells.

Wear suitable footwear
Always wear shoes which support your feet properly and give you a good feeling for the pedals.




Economical driving style
An appropriate driving style reduces consump- tion, environmental pollution and wear and tear on the electric drive system, brakes and tyres. Some tips that are good for the environ- ment and your wallet can be found below.

Drive with anticipation
An erratic driving style reduces range. Fre- quent accelerating and braking can be avoided by keeping an eye on the traffic. Keeping a suf- ficient distance from the vehicle in front helps you to drive with anticipation.

Take advantage of braking energy recupera- tion
If Eco assist ››› page 179 is deactivated in
the infotainment system, position D is engaged and the accelerator pedal is not depressed, the car will coast.

If the assistant is activated in the infotainment system, position D is engaged and the acceler- ator pedal is not depressed, the vehicle auto- matically recuperates energy. While doing so, it adapts to the driving situation and external conditions, such as vehicles in front and speed restrictions. During recuperation, energy from the moving vehicle is used to charge the high-
voltage battery ››› page 153. This causes the
vehicle to slow down.
If the accelerator pedal is not depressed while in position B ››› page 158, Gear selector, very intense recuperation occurs.
This also increases when the brake pedal is de- pressed.

Avoid full throttle
At excessively high speeds, rolling resistance and aerodynamics increase along with the force required to move the vehicle. This re- duces the vehicle's range. Never drive at the vehicle's maximum speed.

Perform regular maintenance
Regular maintenance is essential for economi- cal driving and increases the service life of the vehicle.

Tyre pressure
Very low tyre pressure not only causes tyre wear, but also increases tyre rolling resistance, which reduces the vehicle's range. Use tyres with optimised rolling resistance.
Adapt tyre pressure to the load:
? Please note the information on the tyre pres- sure sticker ››› page 334.
? Tyre pressure loss indicator ››› page 343.
Remove unnecessary weight
Energy consumption can be reduced if the lug- gage compartment is emptied of items such
as snow chains or unused child seats before setting off.
To keep the vehicle's aerodynamic drag as low as possible, remove exterior accessories, such as the ski rack, bike rack or roof rack, when they are no longer needed.

Saving energy
Comfort consumers, such as the air condition- ing or the heated windscreen and window, re- quire energy from the high-voltage battery. If you wish to increase the vehicle's range:
? Set higher vehicle interior temperatures in summer and lower temperatures in winter. If the outside temperature is high, ventilate the vehicle interior before setting off.
? 
Use the stationary air conditioning when charging the battery with an external power
supply ››› page 146.
? Switch off the comfort consumers when they have completed their task.





Driving with a loaded vehicle
In order to achieve appropriate driving char- acteristics when the vehicle is loaded, please note the following:
? Place all luggage securely ››› page 288.
? Accelerate with particular care and precau- tion.
? Avoid sharp braking and sudden manoeu- vres.
? 
Brake earlier than usual.
? If applicable, please note the information about the roof rack ››› page 292.



Driving with the rear lid open
Driving with the rear lid open is particularly dangerous. Secure all objects and the open rear lid correctly and take any necessary meas- ures.


150



Driving with the rear lid open increases the aerodynamic drag of the vehicle, along with the energy consumption of the electric drive system. This therefore considerably reduces the vehicle's possible range. CUPRA therefore recommends that you do not drive with the rear lid open.





Driving on flooded roads
To prevent damage to the vehicle driving on flooded roads, take the following into account:
? Water should never come above the lower edge of the bodywork.
? Drive at pedestrian speed.
? Never stop the vehicle in the water, drive in reverse or disconnect the drive system.
? Vehicles driving in the opposite direction form waves that can raise the water level so high that your vehicle will not be able to cross the water safely.


Trips abroad
The vehicle has been manufactured for a spe- cific country and meets the approval regula- tions in force in that country at the time it was manufactured.
If you are going to use the vehicle abroad tem- porarily or for a short period of time, please observe the relevant instructions.
Some countries have special safety regulations and provisions that the vehicle may not comply with. Before travelling abroad, CUPRA recom- mends that you seek information from one of your dealers about the legal provisions in force in your destination country.
If you are going to sell the vehicle in another country or use it there for a longer period of time, please observe the legal regulations in force in the country in question.
In some cases it may be necessary to install or remove certain equipment at a later date, and to deactivate certain functions. Sets and types


151




of services may also be affected. In particular, this can occur if the vehicle is to be used in an- other climatic region for a long period of time.
Due to the different frequency bands around the world, the factory-fitted infotainment sys- tem may not work in another country.
Due to differing legal regulations in place, charging the high-voltage battery in other countries may only be permitted at a reduced charging current. The charging cable limits the charging current based on the infrastructure that is used. If the settings are different, it is
charged at the lowest value ››› page 90.



Electric drive system functions.
Delivery of power from the electric engine
The maximum torque of the electric engine is available immediately after pressing the accel- erator pedal.

Brake energy recuperation (charging)
When braking the vehicle, electric power is generated through the electric engine and stored in the high-voltage battery
››› page 153. This also occurs to a lesser
extent when the vehicle moves by inertia or drives downhill in the deceleration phase.
As the high-voltage battery's state of charge increases, recuperation reduces along with the engine braking effect. When the high-voltage battery is fully charged, no energy recupera- tion takes place and the engine braking effect
is not available ›››  .
Recovery can be displayed in the Digital Cock- pit or on the infotainment system display.

Slow travel function
The slow travel function consists of driving slowly, at about 5 km/h (3 mph), forward or reverse without pressing the accelerator pedal. The slow travel function is activated automati- cally:
? When the drive system is on and the gear selector is in the D/B or R position.
The slow travel function deactivates if:
? The gear selector is moved to the N position or the electronic parking brake is engaged.



152




Brake energy recuperation (charg- ing)
When braking the vehicle and when the vehi- cle moves by inertia or travels downhill in the deceleration phase, electric power is gener- ated by the electric engine and stored in the high-voltage battery. The electric motor then operates as an alternator and produces a en- gine braking effect. This process is called brake energy recuperation.
The engine braking effect can be more or less intense, depending on the position of the gear
selector ››› page 158. If the recuperation
is very intense, the brake light of the vehicle may also be switched on. As the high-voltage battery's state of charge increases, recupera- tion reduces along with the engine braking effect. When the high-voltage battery is fully charged, no energy recuperation takes place and there is no engine braking effect. When the vehicle detects that road conditions do not allow safe contact between the wheels and the road surface, energy recuperation is automat- ically reduced, along with the engine braking effect. The power indicator provides informa- tion about the availability of recuperation and
the engine braking effect ››› page 17.
The vehicle recuperates energy differently de- pending on the selected gear position and the infotainment system settings:
? 
Position D selected and Eco Assist switched off››› page 179: no recuperation takes place. Recovery is medium with the Performance or
CUPRA profile.
? Position D selected and Eco Assist activa- ted ››› page 179: automatic recuperation.
The recuperation level is automatically selec- ted based on navigation data and the traffic situation.
? Position B selected: intense recuperation.
The vehicle also recovers energy when the brake pedal is depressed.

Eco Assistance
Eco assist helps the driver to make efficient use of the vehicle's engine braking effect
››› page 179. It selects the recuperation level
based on navigation data and traffic situation.
The assistant can be switched on and off in the infotainment system's vehicle settings.

Driving down slopes
On descents, position B should be selected whenever possible.
Never let the vehicle roll downhill with position
N neutral selected.




Troubleshooting

Now only manoeuvring is possible!
Charge. Check the manual
The control lamp lights up in red to warn you that the system's power is very limited and the vehicle may soon stop in the middle of the road.
A message is displayed in the Digital Cockpit and an audible warning sounds.
The air conditioning comfort functions are re- stricted ››› page 135.


153




This may occur due to the following condi- tions:
? Very low state of charge of the high-volt- age battery.
- The control lamp comes on while the vehicle is moving. From this moment on- wards, the vehicle can be started twice
››› page 155.
If traffic conditions permit, move the vehicle onto the right hand side of the road and park it safely, or go to a charging station if possi- ble.
? Temperature and state of charge of the high-voltage battery.
- The control lamp turns on before the drive system is switched on. Only manoeuvring is possible (at a speed of up to 7 km/h [4 mph]).
CUPRA recommends that you charge the high-voltage battery and prepare the car for
departure ››› page 147.



Limited power. Check the manual
The control lamp lights up yellow to warn you that the power has decreased significantly and may decrease further.
A message is displayed in the Digital Cockpit and an audible warning sounds.
The air conditioning comfort functions are re- stricted ››› page 135.
As soon as the battery power increases again, the control lamp turns off.
Depending on the state of charge, CUPRA rec- ommends:
? When the state of charge is low, the high- voltage battery must be charged.
? With a high state of charge and very high
or low outside temperatures, the high voltage battery heats up or cools down while driving. After a certain amount of time, the available power increases again.

Connecting and discon- necting the drive system

OR: leave the vehicle when it is stopped and the electroNic parking brake is applied.
The ignition will also switch off when the ve- hicle is stopped, the brake pedal is not de- pressed, the electronic parking brake applied and the driver releases the seat belt on his/her seat.

Automatic ignition disconnection
If the driver leaves the ignition on but walks away from the vehicle, taking the vehicle key with him/her, the ignition switches off auto- matically after a certain period of time. If the front bonnet is opened while the ignition is switched on, it does not switch off automati- cally. The electronic parking brake is applied automatically when you leave the vehicle.
If no valid key is detected in the vehicle interior after the ignition has been switched off, the system cannot be switched on again without
a valid key. A message to this effect will be dis- played in the digital cockpit.

3. Activate door locking. The Digital Cockpit switches off.



Never leave the vehicle with the drive system connected
If after stopping the vehicle you leave it with the drive system switched on and a gear selec- ted, the ignition and drive system switch off automatically under certain conditions.
This protects the vehicle against unauthorised use.
The electronic parking brake is applied auto- matically ››› page 205.
If you then wish to continue driving, you have to turn the ignition on again ››› page 154, e.g. by depressing the brake pedal, along with the drive system ››› page 155. If necessary, follow the instructions in the Digital Cockpit.

Automatic operation of the side light
If the dipped beam is switched on when the ig- nition switches off automatically, the side light will turn on until the vehicle is locked, or for a maximum of approx. 15 minutes.

Electronic immobilizer
The electronic immobiliser helps to prevent the drive system from being connected with an unauthorised key and, consequently, the vehicle being put in motion.
The vehicle key has an integrated chip which automatically deactivates the electronic im- mobiliser if there is a valid key inside the vehi- cle interior.
The electronic immobiliser is automatically ac- tivated when there is no longer a valid key in- side the vehicle.
For this reason, the vehicle's drive system can only be connected with a correctly coded Original CUPRA key. This type of key can be purchased from a specialised CUPRA dealer or any SEAT network dealer.

Drive Profiles
Introduction
The driver can use the drive profiles to adapt various features of the vehicle's systems to the current driving situation, the desired driving comfort and an economical driving style. Some of the systems that can be adapted are the suspension, steering, drive system and air con- ditioning.
Depending on the vehicle's equipment, vari- ous drive profiles can be selected. The degree of influence of the vehicle's systems on the dif- ferent drive profiles depends on the vehicle's equipment.

Vehicles with adaptive suspension (DCC)
When driving, the adaptive suspension (DCC) continuously adapts the suspension to the terrain and the driving situation in question. When doing so, the DCC also takes into ac- count the vehicle's configuration in the selec- ted drive profile.

Engine sound
It adds excitement to driving by improving on the sound of the electric motor through the Infotainment System, depending on the selec- ted drive profile. This sound is based on the CUPRA "Adrenaline" concept. Its volume is in

proportion to the pressure exerted on the ac- celerator pedal and the RPM of the electric motor. The configuration is preset for each profile and can be modified in the Individual profile.

Selecting a drive profile








The drive profile can be selected when the ig- nition is switched on and the vehicle is station-
ary or moving ›››  .

Selecting a drive profile
? Access the main	Drive Profile menu. The available profiles will be displayed.
? OR: With the Infotainment System turned off, by pressing on the Drive Profile icon, the available drive profiles will be displayed.
? OR: Press the 1) button on the multifunc- tion steering wheel ››› Fig. 111 to activate the Cupra drive profile.
? OR: Repeatedly press the  1) button on the multifunction steering wheel ››› Fig. 111 to switch between drive profiles.

Kick-down
Depending on the version, the kick-down de- vice allows maximum acceleration with the gear selector in the D/B position in any drive profile.
To use it, fully depress the accelerator pedal through the point of resistance. This uses the vehicle's maximum acceleration.







Racestart
The Racestart program provides a sportier feel and enables maximum acceleration from a standstill.
Conditions:
? The steering wheel direction must be straight (pointing forwards).
? Auto Hold must be deactivated
››› page 207.
? The position of the gear selector must be in
D or B.

How to activate Racestart
1. Press hard on the brake pedal with your left foot and hold it down for at least 1 second.
2. While keeping the brake pedal depressed, simultaneously press the accelerator pedal fully down with the right foot (kick-down
››› page 162).
3. After fully depressing the accelerator (kick- down) for more than 1 second, quickly remove your left foot from the brake
pedal, while keeping the accelerator fully depressed. The vehicle starts with maxi- mum acceleration.
Finally, if it was activated previously, reactivate the Auto Hold function.

? Please note that different vehicle systems are configured according to the selected drive profile.

in the brake pads, the emergency braking
distance is longer than after they have been run in. During the run-in, avoid sharp braking and situations that place a lot of demand on the brakes, e.g. driving too close to another vehicle.
Brake pad wear depends to a large extent on the conditions in which the vehicle is used, and driving style. If the vehicle is frequently used
in city traffic and for short distances, or for sporty driving, brake pad thickness should be checked regularly at a specialist workshop.
Driving with wet brakes, e.g. after driving through water, in heavy rain or after washing the vehicle, braking performance may be af- fected by wet brake discs, or even frozen discs in winter. The driver should be ready to brake harder.
If the brake discs and pads have a layer
of salt on them, the braking performance is reduced and the braking distance increases. When driving on salted roads without brak- ing for some time, the layer of salt should
be removed by carefully applying the brakes a few times ››› . Braking intensity should


164



be higher than the deceleration achieved by brake energy recuperation, in order to clean off the layer of salt with the brake pad friction.
Corrosion on the brake discs and dirt on the brake pads increase if the vehicle is left unused for a long time, if it is not driven for many kil- ometres or the brakes are used insufficiently. If, due to the energy recuperation effect, the brakes are not used, or are rarely used, or if there is corrosion, it is advisable to clean the discs and pads by braking hard several times when driving at high speeds. When doing so, select gear N, so that energy recuperation is not used when braking. Make sure that you do not endanger any other vehicles or road users

Brake assist systems
Information relating to brake assist systems
Brake assist systems can help the driver in crit- ical driving or braking situations. The driver is
responsible for driving safely ›››  .
When the brake assist systems are regulating the brakes, the brake pedal may move or make noises. Even so, continue to brake with the necessary force and control the trajectory of the vehicle if necessary.
Depending on the equipment, the ESC and TCS settings can be changed in the vehicle.
? The ESC, ABS and TCS can only operate cor- rectly if the four wheels are fitted with the
stipulated tyres ›››  .
? If a fault occurs in the ABS, the ESC, TCS and EDS also cease to function.

Electronic Stability Control (ESC)
The ESC helps to reduce the risk of skidding and to improve stability in certain driving situa-
tions ›››  .

Traction control (TCS)
The TCS reduces the driving force on skidding wheels and adapts this force to suit the road surface conditions. The TCS facilitates starting,
acceleration and hill climbing ›››  .
Electronic brake pressure distribution (EBV)
Electronic brake force distribution (EBV) regu- lates the braking force between the front and rear axles. Excessive braking of the rear axle is avoided and the vehicle remains stable during the braking operation.

Anti-lock braking system (ABS),
The ABS can prevent the wheels from locking up under braking until shortly before the vehi- cle comes to a stop, and helps the driver main- tain control of the steering and the vehicle
››› .
Brake assist (BAS)
Brake assist (BAS) can help to reduce the brak- ing distance. Brake Assist increases the pres- sure exerted by the driver when the brake pedal is depressed quickly in an emergency.

Electronic differential lock (EDS and XDS)
The EDS automatically brakes skidding wheels and transmits the driving force to the other driving wheels.
XDS improves traction by applying the brakes to improve cornering acceleration.




Multi-collision brake
The multi-collision brake automatically triggers braking if the airbag control unit detects a col- lision in the event of an accident.
Automatic braking requirements:
? The driver is not pressing the accelerator pedal.

Trailer stabilisation1)
Note that the vehicle-trailer assembly gener- ally tends to snake. When the snaking of the trailer is felt by the vehicle and detected by the ESC, it will automatically brake the towing vehi- cle within the limits of the system and stabiliser
the vehicle-trailer set ››› page 300.
Electromechanical brake servo (eBKV)
With the ignition switched on, the electrome- chanical brake servo (eBKV) supplements the force exerted by the foot by increasing the pressure that the driver exerts on the brake
pedal ›››  . When a driver assistance system
apples the brakes, e.g. ACC when regulating the speed, or during emergency braking, the brake pedal may move automatically.
After disconnecting the ignition, the assistance of the brake servo is progressively reduced. If you continue to hold the vehicle in place with

the brake pedal, messages are displayed on the instrument cluster screen. In this case, the brake servo function is restricted.
Once stopped, immobilise the vehicle to pre- vent it from moving ››› page 204.

Brake blending
The regulated application of the brakes blends the braking effect of the electric motor in en- ergy recuperation and the mechanical braking by the driver.

Connecting and disconnecting the ESC and TCS
The ESC is switched on automatically when the engine is started, and only works when the en- gine is running and includes the ABS, EDS and TCS systems.

Disconnecting and connecting the ESC in "Sport" mode
The ECS in "Sport" mode can be turned on or off in the infotainment system: press the function button	> Assistants > ESC menu
››› page 33.
When "Sport" mode is connected, the inter- ventions of the ESC to stabilise the vehicle, and the traction control (TCS) interventions are limited. In addition, the  control lamp lights up on the instrument cluster.

Disconnecting and connecting the ESC
The ESC can be switched on and off in the infotainment system: press	> Assistants >
ESC Menu ››› page 33.
It can only be switched off if the vehicle is stopped or moving at a maximum speed of 10 km/h.
When ESC is switched off, the traction control (TCS) is still activated, but its intervention is limited. In addition, the  control lamp lights up on the instrument panel.




Troubleshooting

    The electromechanical brake servo is not working
Stop driving
The warning lamp lights up red.
A message is displayed as appropriate. Depress the brake pedal hard because the braking dis- tance will increase due to the lack of brake as- sist from the brake servo.
? You should obtain professional assistance immediately.

    There is a fault in the electromechanical brake servo
The control lamp switches on yellow.
A message is displayed for a few seconds.
Depressing the brake pedal may cause vibra- tions. The brake pedal has to be pressed harder because the braking distance increases due to the reduced brake servo assistance.
? Contact a specialised workshop.

Cruise control system
Introduction
The cruise control system (GRA) helps main- tain a constant speed set by you.

Speed range
The cruise control system is available when driving in forward gear at a speed of over ap- prox. 20 km/h (15 mph).

Temporarily switching off the cruise control
The saved speed can be exceeded at any time, e.g. for overtaking. The cruise control is suspended during acceleration and is then re- sumed with the saved speed.

Speed limiter with proac- tive speed adjustment
Introduction
The speed limiter with proactive speed adjust- ment automatically adapts a maximum speed that you have saved to the detected speed lim- its.
The speed limiter with proactive speed adjust- ment is an additional function of the speed limiter and uses the infotainment system's dy-
namic road sign display ››› page 26 and navi-
gation data.

The speed limiter with proactive speed adjust- ment is available depending on the equipment, but not in all countries.






Limitations of proactive speed ad- justment
In addition to the limitations of the dynamic road sign display system, the speed limiter with proactive speed adjustment has the following limitations inherent to the system:
? The speed limiter with proactive speed ad- justment only recognises road signs showing a speed limit.
? Road signs that indirectly show a speed re- striction, e.g. signs at the entrance to towns, are only recognised on the basis of navigation data.


177




? If a warning is given of a speed restriction based on navigation data, without it being de- tected by the dynamic road sign display, the indicated speed will be adjusted to the most recently saved speed.
? The speed limiter with proactive speed ad- justment is not available for speed restrictions lower than approx. 30 km/h (approx. 20 mph) that are detected. In this case, a relevant mes- sage is displayed on the instrument cluster dis- play.

Activate proactive speed adjust- ment
The speed limiter with proactive speed adjust- ment can be activated in the infotainment sys- tem's assistants menu.

Driving with proactive speed ad- justment
? Activate the proactive speed adjustment.
? Switch on the speed limiter and start the control ››› page 175.
? When the system recognises a new speed limit, a warning is displayed on the instrument cluster. This speed will be stored in the speed limiter.
The system has recognised a new speed limit and uses it for regulation.

Interrupting speed adjustment
? Press the button	on the multifunction steering wheel or release and press the accel- erator pedal twice. The last saved speed is re- sumed.
? Press the	button on the multifunction steering wheel. The current speed is taken.
? Press the  button on the multifunction steering wheel. The system switches to a pas- sive state.

Adjust the displayed speed using the buttons on the multifunction steering wheel
? Tapping the buttons or will change the speed by 1 km/h (1 mph).
? Sliding your finger over or will change the speed by 10 km/h (5 mph).
If you adjust the indicated speed excessively, the proactive speed adjustment is interrupted.





Troubleshooting
A message is displayed indicating that pro- active speed adjustment is not currently available or not offered in your country.
? If this message is displayed for a longer pe- riod of time and proactive speed adjustment is available in your country, please contact a specialist workshop.

Eco Assistance








Eco Assist helps you to drive with anticipation and low energy consumption by means of sit- uation-dependent instructions superimposed on the digital instrument cluster and/or the headup display (HUD)
When you approach places such as a junc- tion, a roundabout or a section of road with
a speed limit, the symbol	is displayed along with an event on the digital instrument cluster
››› Fig. 120.
As soon as you follow the indication and
take your foot off the accelerator, the vehicle adapts, based on the selected driving profile and distance to the event, brake energy recu- peration and speed.

Eco Assist uses the trip data from the infotain- ment system and the sensors of certain driver assistance systems. If no destination guidance is active, the most likely route is used.
Pressing the accelerator can cancel the inter- vention of the assistance at any time.
Eco Assist can be activated and deactivated in the infotainment system, in the assistance sys-
tem settings ››› page 33.
Eco Assist is temporarily deactivated if:
? The Performance or CUPRA driving profile is used.
? Driving with adaptive cruise control (ACC).
When these conditions no longer exist, the as- sistance is reactivated if it is switched on in the assistance system settings.
Eco Assist is available depending on equip- ment and not in all countries.

Symbols
Take your foot off the accelerator Approaching a junction on the left Approaching a junction on the right Approaching a motorway slip road or exit Approaching a roundabout

Approaching a junction Approaching a left curve Approaching a right curve
You approach a speed limit, example.





179



Speed range
You can set a speed between 20 km/h (15 mph) and the maximum speed of the vehicle.
The ACC can bring the vehicle to a standstill if a vehicle in front stops.

Driving with ACC
You can override the ACC at any time. Brak- ing interrupts the ACC. If you accelerate, reg- ulation is interrupted during acceleration and then resumed.


ACC - Adaptive Cruise Control
Introduction
Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) maintains a constant speed set by the driver. When ap- proaching another vehicle in front, the ACC detects it and adapts the speed automatically, maintaining a distance set by the driver.

Does my vehicle have ACC?
Your vehicle has ACC if it has a configuration menu in the infotainment system.


Driver intervention prompt
 ACC is subject to certain limitations in- herent to the system. This means that the driver will have to control the speed and distance from other vehicles in certain sit- uations. In this case, the instrument clus- ter display will tell you to intervene by applying the brake, and an audio warning will be played.

Radar sensors
The ACC uses the front radar technology. Read its maintenance instructions and information
about its limitations ››› page 170.

The ACC does not regulate anything yet (standby).

Start regulation
Activating the ACC system also automatically activates the ESC and traction control (TCS).
? To start regulation, press the  button
››› Fig. 122.
The ACC saves the current speed and main- tains the set distance. If the current speed
is outside the predefined speed range, ACC adjusts the speed to the nearest limit of the range.
Depending on the driving situation, the follow- ing indicator lamps come on:
Lights up green
ACC connected, no vehicle detected in front.

Program the distance setting
The distance can be set to one of five levels, from very short to very long:
? Press the button and then or button
››› Fig. 122.
? Alternatively, press button as many times as necessary to set the desired distance.
Keep in mind each country's regulations on minimum braking distances.

Suspend regulation (standby)
? Briefly press  button ››› Fig. 122 or press the brake pedal.
The ACC indicator lamp is grey; the speed and distance are saved.
If the ESC or TCS is switched off, the ACC is automatically interrupted.

Reinstating the cruise control
? Press the	button. The ACC regulates to the last speed and distance setting.
? OR: Press	button to regulate to the cur- rent speed.

Exceeding the speed regulated by the ACC
While driving with the ACC switched on, the driver can increase speed by pressing the ac- celerator pedal. ACC regulation is suspended
until you release the accelerator pedal ›››  .
Set the default distance setting
In the Infotainment system, you can pre-select the distance level when connecting the ACC from:
? Very short, Short, Medium, Long and Very long using the Infotainment system:	> Assis-
tants > Smart Assistants > ACC ››› page 33.

Special driving situations












Be aware of the limitations and warnings described at the beginning of this chapter
››› page 180, Introduction.

Avoid undertaking on the right1)
If a vehicle is detected in the left lane that is travelling at a speed slower than that set by the driver, it will brake the vehicle within the comfort limits of the system to avoid passing it
on the right ››› Fig. 123.
You can cancel this regulation by pressing the accelerator pedal.

The function works at speeds over 80 km/h (50 mph). It may not be available in certain countries.

Overtaking
When the turn signal is switched on for over- taking, the ACC reduces the distance from the vehicle in front to help with the overtaking ma- noeuvre. The set cruising speed will not be ex- ceeded.
The function works at speeds over 80 km/h (50 mph). It may not be available in certain countries.

Stop&Go function
The ACC can bring the vehicle to a standstill if the vehicle in front stops.
The ACC remains active and the message ACC ready to start is displayed on the instrument cluster for a few seconds. You can extend or reactivate this warning by pressing the	but- ton or by grabbing the wheel if your vehicle is fitted with Travel Assist. During this time, the vehicle will move off again if the vehicle in front moves forwards.

To move off when the message ACC ready to start is not longer displayed, once the vehicle in front has moved off:
? Press the accelerator pedal.
? OR: press the	button on the multifunc- tion steering wheel.
? OR: grab the steering wheel again if your ve- hicle has Travel Assist.
The ACC does not remain active in the follow- ing cases:
? The stopping phase lasts for several minutes.
? When a vehicle door is opened.
? If the ignition is switched off.

Stopped vehicles
ACC can react to stopped vehicles up to a speed of approximately 60 km/h (37 mph), provided that the stopped vehicle is recog- nised. ACC will comfortably brake to a stop behind the vehicle, within the limits of the sys- tem.
The response to stopped vehicles depends on the vehicle's equipment and is not available in all countries.

ACC system limitations
The limits of the ACC system mean that it is not appropriate in all situations ››› in Introduc- tion on page 180.
CUPRA does not recommend using the func- tion in the following cases ››› :
? Heavy rain, snow or fog.
? When going through tunnels.
? On stretches of road with roadworks.
? On routes with curves, e.g. on mountain roads.
? On off-road routes.
? In covered car parks.
? On roads with embedded metal objects such as train or tram tracks.
? On roads with loose gravel.
Pay special attention when using ACC in the following situations:


The ACC may not detect the vehicle in front on a curve, or may regulate the distance from
vehicles in other lanes ››› Fig. 124.
Vehicles outside the sensor zone

In the following situations the ACC may not react, or may react slowly or inappropriately:
? Vehicles that are not aligned while driving or that are outside the sensor's detection area,
such as motorcycles ››› Fig. 125.
? Vehicles that move into your lane, a short distance from your vehicle ››› Fig. 126.
? Vehicles with loads or accessories that pro- trude from the sides, rear or roof.


184




Objects that are not detected











The ACC function only detects and reacts to vehicles moving in the same direction. There- fore it does not detect:
? People
? Animals
? Vehicles travelling in the opposite direction or crossing the road.
? Other stationary obstacles






Troubleshooting
ACC not available

The indicator lamp lights up yellow:
? The radar sensor is dirty or adjusted in- correctly. Take into account the warnings described at the beginning of this chapter
››› page 170
? There is a fault or a defect. Turn off the vehi- cle's ignition and turn it on again after a few minutes.
? If the problem persists, consult a specialised workshop.

The ACC does not work as expected
? Make sure that the conditions are met for the radar sensor to operate properly ››› page 170.
? If the brakes overheat, regulation stops au- tomatically. Wait for them to cool down and check the operation again.
? Unusual noises during automatic ACC brak- ing are normal and do not indicate any anoma- lies.

The following conditions may lead the ACC not to react:
? The accelerator or brake is depressed.
? No gear is engaged or the vehicle is in gear R.
? The vehicle is reversing.
? ESC is operating.
? The driver is not wearing his/her seat belt.
? A vehicle brake light is faulty.

The predictive speed adjustment adapts the speed to the speed limits detected and to the road layout (curves, crossings, roundabouts, etc.).
Predictive speed adjustment is an additional function of the ACC ››› page 180 and uses
the road signal detection system and the navi- gation data of the infotainment system.
Predictive speed adjustment is available de- pending on the equipment, although not in all countries.

Reaction at the end of a traffic jam
Vehicles with Car2X technology (depending on the equipment and not in all countries) can interact with other vehicles in their vicinity.
This allows your vehicle to receive information about the presence of a traffic jam ahead and to reduce speed in time.
Requirements:


185




? Car2X activated in the infotainment system.
? The option to react at the end of traffic jams is activated in the infotainment system
››› page 186.






Limitations of the predictive speed adjustment
In addition to the limitations of the road sign detection system and the limitations of the ACC, predictive speed adjustment has the fol- lowing limitations inherent to the system:
? Predictive speed adjustment only recognises road signals that show a speed limit. The pre- dictive speed adjustment does not take into account, above all, the rules on priority of pas- sage or traffic lights.
? Road signs that indirectly show a speed re- striction, e.g. signs at the entrance to towns, are only recognised on the basis of navigation data.
? 
On roads that are not included in the naviga- tion data, or that are included with low accu- racy, predictive speed adjustment is not availa- ble.
? If a speed limit is notified based on the nav- igation data without it being detected by the road signal detection system, the indicated speed will be adjusted to the speed that was saved the last time.
? Predictive speed adjustment is not available for speed limits below approx. 20 km/h (ap- prox. 15 mph). In this case, a relevant message is displayed on the instrument cluster display.

Activating the predictive speed ad- justment
In the infotainment system, in the assist serv- ices menu, you can individually adjust the type of incident the vehicle should react to
››› page 33:
? Response to road layout.
? Response at permitted speeds.
? Reaction to a traffic jam.

Driving with predictive speed ad- justment
? Connect the ACC ››› page 181.
? Set the distance and speed.
? Activate the predictive speed adjustment.


186




As soon as the system recognises a speed limit or a relevant road layout during the route, a warning will appear on the instrument cluster display. This warning will indicate the reason and the speed to which the vehicle will adjust due to said limitation.

Indication of turning intention
If the turn signals are activated to indicate the intention to turn, the predictive cruise control can reduce the speed at the next available turn.
The predictive cruise control does not detect the intention to turn in the following situations:
? A dashed line is recognised in the direction in which the turn signal is activated.
? The turn signals are not activated sufficiently far in advance.
Indication of regulation in progress
Adjustment due to a speed limit.

Adjustment due to the end of a speed limit.
Adjustment due to a roundabout. Adjustment due to a junction.
Adjustment due to a road layout. Regulation due to a traffic jam.

In the event of adjustment due to a speed limit, the detected speed will be saved as the new desired speed. In the event of adjustment due to the road layout, the vehicle will accelerate again after leaving the reason for the adjust- ment behind and the speed will be adjusted to the saved speed.
The speeds indicated for curves depend on the drive profile››› page 162.

Interrupting speed adjustment
? During the warning, press the button  .
? During the regulation, press the button	.

Adjust the announced speed
The announced speed can only be adjusted in the event of adjustment due to a speed limit.

Multifunction steering wheel
? Tapping the buttons or will change the speed by 1 km/h (1 mph).
? Sliding your finger over or will change the speed by 10 km/h (5 mph).
If you adjust the indicated speed excessively, the predictive speed adjustment is interrupted.











Troubleshooting
A message is displayed indicating that pre- dictive speed adjustment is not currently available or not available in your country.
? If this message is displayed for a long time and predictive speed adjustment is available in your country, contact a specialised workshop.






Switch between driver assistance systems
Depending on the equipment, you can switch to the following driver assistance systems:
? Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC)
? Cruise control system.
? Speed limiter.

Emergency brake assis- tance system (Front As- sist)
Introduction
The objective of the system is to prevent head- on collisions against objects that may be in the vehicle's path or minimise the consequences of such impacts.

The function is designed to avoid collisions against:
? Parked vehicles.
? Vehicles, pedestrians and cyclists that are travelling in the same lane and direction.
? Pedestrians and cyclists who transversely cross the vehicle path.
Front Assist detects these objects using a camera on the top of the windscreen and a radar sensor on the front of the vehicle
››› page 170.
Depending on several factors and how critical the situation is, the system operates in a stag- gered manner.

First by informing the driver, and if there is no or insufficient reaction, then by activating an autonomous emergency braking or an evasive manoeuvre as indicated by the conditions that will be discussed in the following points.
The system can be cancelled if the accelerator pedal is pressed or the steering wheel is turned firmly.
Depending on the equipment and the country, Front Assist also includes the following func- tions:
? Pedestrian protection ››› page 189
? Cyclist protection ››› page 189
? Dodge assist ››› page 189
? Turn-off assist ››› page 189

 
Warning levels and brake assist
Front Assist is active from 5 km/h (3 mph). Depending on different conditions (vehicle speed, speed and type of object recognised, etc.), some of the stages described below are omitted to optimise the performance of the system.

Safety distance warning
If the system detects that you are driving too close to the vehicle in front, it will warn the driver with
this indication on the instrument cluster display.
The timing of the warning varies depending
on driver behaviour, vehicle speed and relative speed between both.
The safety distance warning is active from ap- prox. 65 km/h (40 mph).

Advance warning
If the system detects a possible collision with the vehicle in front, it alerts the driver by means of an audible warning
and an indication on the instrument panel display .
The warning moment varies depending on the traffic situation and driver behaviour. At the same time, the vehicle will prepare for a possi-
ble emergency braking ›››	in Introduction
on page 188.




When Front Assist is connected, the indica- tions of other functions on the screen may be hidden.

Critical warning
If the driver fails to react to the advance warn- ing, the system may actively intervene in the brakes and generate a brief jolt to warn the driver of the imminent danger of a collision.

Automatic braking
If the driver also fails to react to the critical warning, the system may initiate independent emergency braking by progressively increasing the braking in accordance with the criticality of the situation.

Driver emergency braking assistance system
If the driver, after the critical warning, starts braking but the system detects that the brake is not being applied with sufficient force, the braking intensity will be increased. This brake assist only occurs if the pedal is pressed firmly.




 Pedestrian and cyclist recognition
The system recognises pedestrians and cyclists who travel in the same lane and direction and pedestrians and cyclists who transversely cross the vehicle's path.
Pedestrian and cyclist recognition technology cannot exceed the physically prescribed limits and works exclusively within the system's limits. The responsibility for braking always depends on the driver.
The pedestrian and cyclist recognition can cause undesired warnings and braking inter- ventions, e.g. with a hidden radar sensor or a dirty camera field of vision.
Be ready to take charge of the vehicle at any time.
The pedestrian and cyclist recognition operat- ing speed range is lower than that of Front As- sist.

Dodge assist
Dodge assist helps the driver avoid an obstacle in critical conditions.
Once the Front Assist has activated a critical warning, if the driver intends to dodge the ob- ject, the swerve assist will help correct the tra- jectory. The driver must start and finish the manoeuvre, as this is an assistance system and not an autonomous one.
The system is active between approximately 30 km/h (20 mph) and 150 km/h (90 mph).

Limitations
This system does not react to objects crossing the path of the vehicle or to animals. The basic limitations of Front Assist must also be taken
into account››› page 190.

Turn-off assist
Turn-off assist can avoid a collision with a vehi- cle approaching in the opposite direction, by braking the vehicle itself when the intention is to turn.
This system is active up to 20 km/h (12 mph).

190

Limitations
The turn-off assist function is available if you have indicated your intention to turn by acti- vating the turn signal, you have turned the steering wheel and the turning path has star- ted.
It only reacts to vehicles that are in the path of the vehicle (not to animals, people, etc.).
The basic limitations of Front Assist must also be taken into account››› page 190.

System limitations
Front Assist has certain limitations inherent to the system. Thus, in certain circumstances, some of the reactions may be inappropriate from the driver's standpoint. So pay attention in order to intervene if necessary.
The following conditions may cause the Front Assist not to react or to do so too late:
The indication will be shown on the in- strument cluster display in the first few instants of driving after switching on the
ignition, due to the system's initial auto- calibration.

Unrecognised objects
? Vehicles travelling outside the reach of the sensors at close range from your own vehicle.
? Vehicles that suddenly change to the lane on which your vehicle is travelling.
? 
Pedestrians that cannot be recognised be- cause they are partially or totally hidden.
? Objects such as walls, posts, fences, trees or garage doors.
? Loads and accessories of other vehicles that protrude over the sides, backwards or over the top.
? In the case of pedestrians or cyclists standing or approaching in the opposite direction.

Operating limitations
In the following situations, Front Assist may work in a limited or unwanted way:

? If the Front Assist or the front camera are disabled or broken.
? If the radar sensor or the front camera are dirty or covered.
? On taking tight bends or complex paths.
? When pressing the accelerator firmly or at full throttle.
? If the ESC is adjusting or is broken.
? If several brake lights of the vehicle or electri- cally connected trailer are damaged.
? If the vehicle is reversing.
? In case of snow or heavy rain.
? In case of dazzling sun or total darkness.
? Entrances and exits of tunnels.
? 
In complex driving situations (such as traffic islands, cut-through roundabouts, etc.), Front Assist may issue warnings and unnecessarily in- tervene in braking.
For more details, see section ››› page 170,
System limits.

Manual activation and deactivation of the function
Front Assist indicators appear on the instru- ment panel display.
Front Assist is active whenever the ignition is switched on. When the vehicle is started, Front Assist may not be available for a short period of time while the system starts. During this phase, the instrument cluster screen will display the following indication .
When Front Assist is deactivated, so too are the advance warning and the distance warning functions.
CUPRA recommends leaving Front Assist ac- tivated except in the situations explained in section page 191, Temporarily deactivating Front Assist.

Activating and deactivating Front Assist
With the ignition switched on, Front Assist can be deactivated or activated as follows:
? In the infotainment system: press the func- tion button	> Driver assist > Smart Assis-
tants > Front Assist ››› page 33.

Lane Assist system


This indication will be displayed in the in- strument cluster when Front Assist is de- activated.
Each time the ignition is switched on, Front Assist will reappear as active.

Switching distance warning on and off
The safety distance warning can be activated or deactivated in the infotainment system us- ing the function button  > Driver assist >
Smart Assistants > Front Assist ››› page 33.
Each time the ignition is switched on, the dis- tance warning will reappear as active.
CUPRA recommends having the safety dis- tance warning activated except in the excep- tions described in section page 191, Tempo- rarily deactivating Front Assist.

Activating or deactivating the swerve and turn assist
The swerve and turn assistance systems can be activated or deactivated in the infotain- ment system using the function button	> Driver assist > Smart Assistants > Front Assist
››› page 33.
Whenever the ignition is switched on, the swerve and turn assist will reappear as active.
CUPRA recommends having the swerve and turn assistance systems activated except in the exceptions described in section page 191, Temporarily deactivating Front Assist .


Temporarily deactivating Front Assist
In the following situations Front Assist should be deactivated due to the system's limitations:
? When the vehicle is to be towed.
? If the vehicle is on a test bed.
? If the radar sensor or the front camera is faulty.
? If the radar sensor or the front camera has suffered a violent blow.
? If it intervenes several times unnecessarily.
? If the radar sensor or the front camera is temporarily covered by an accessory.
? When the vehicle is going to be loaded onto transportation.
? If the windscreen is damaged in an area that covers the vision of the front camera.

Lane Assist system
Introduction
The Lane Assist System helps the driver stay in his/her lane within the physical limits of the system. This function is not suitable and is not designed to keep the vehicle automatically in the lane.
Using the camera located in the windscreen, the Lane Assist system detects the lane boun- daries dividing the lanes in which the vehi-
cle is travelling. If the vehicle gets too close to the detected lane limits, the system alerts


the driver through a corrective motion of the steering wheel. The driver can cancel the steering corrective action at any time.
No warning will be given when the turn signals are activated, given that the Lane Assist system understands that a lane change is required.

System limits
Use the Lane Assist system only on large, well- maintained motorways and highways.
The system is not available under the following conditions:
? The driving speed allowed is below approx. 60 km/h (35 mph).
? The system has not detected any lane lines.
? On tight bends.
? Temporarily in very sporty driving situations.
? If the driver firmly rectifies a system interven- tion.
? If a lane marking is crossed despite system intervention.
? If the driver does not react to a request to intervene.

1 Yellow line: The system intervenes assisting on the represented side.
2 White line: Lane line detected. The system is ready to intervene on the displayed side. When the line is grey, the lane line is de- tected but the system is in a passive state or not available for intervention.
Depending on the equipment, additional de- tails of the lane marking line currently detec- ted by the camera, e.g. dashed road markings, can also be displayed on the instrument cluster display.
Depending on the equipment, there is also an indication on the Head-up-Display
››› page 18.

Control lamps
Lights up grey
Lane departure warning system switched to passive and not available for
guidance.
Lights up green
Lane Assist system active and available.
Lights up yellow
The Lane Assist system is intervening by adjusting the steering.

Switching the lane assist system on or off
In some countries, the Lane Assist system is always activated when the ignition is switched on. The connection status is displayed in the infotainment system's	Vehicle menu. This menu can also be used for activation and de- activation.

The Lane Assist system is designed to actively intervene as of approximately 65 km/h (40 mph) and if it has detected the lane bounda- ries (system status: active).
When a turn signal is activated, the system temporarily switches to a passive state in the indicated direction and is available for opera- tion in the opposite direction.
An energetic rotation or rectification of the steering wheel by the driver causes the system to temporarily switch to a passive state.

When Lane Assist is switched off, the yel- low disconnection warning lamp lights up in the instrument cluster (depending on
the country).


Driver intervention prompt
If the steering is not corrected manually, the system prompts the driver an indication on the instrument cluster display and audible warn- ings.
If no reaction is obtained from the driver, the system switches to a passive state.
Depending on the equipment, Emergency As- sist is activated.
Regardless of the steering manoeuvres, an in- dication on the instrument cluster display and audible warnings also prompt the driver to drive in the middle of the lane if the steering correction lasts longer than reasonable.

Steering wheel vibration
The following situations may result in a steering wheel vibration:
? The lane ceases to be recognised during a sudden intervention in the steering by the sys- tem.

It is also possible to select steering wheel vibra- tion in the Vehicle menu of the infotainment system. In this case, when a vehicle with Lane Assist switched on crosses over a detected lane marking, the steering wheel will vibrate.

Troubleshooting

      The lane departure warning assistant is not available
The control lamp lights up in yellow. A relevant warning is also displayed on the instrument cluster display.
? There is a fault or a defect. Turn the drive system off and on again.
? The field of vision of the camera is dirty. Clean the windscreen ››› page 346.
? The camera has decreased visibility due to accessories or adhesives.
If the camera's field of view is affected by dirt, snow, accessories, stickers or other obstruc- tions, the following temporary message may appear on the instrument cluster, accompa- nied by an audible warning:
"	Limited driver assist now. Front sensors without visibility."
See more information on this topic in the section "Drive assist sensors and cameras"
››› page 170.



193




The system behaves differently than expec- ted
? The camera has been altered or damaged,
e.g. because of damage caused to the wind- screen. Check for visible damage.
? Do not mount objects on the steering wheel.
If the problem persists, consult a specialised workshop.





Travel Assist
Introduction
Travel Assist combines adaptive cruise control (ACC) and the adaptive lane guidance func- tion. Within the limitations of the system, the vehicle can maintain a distance from the vehi- cle in front that is preselected by the driver and remain in the preferred position within the lane.

Travel Assist uses the same sensors as Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and Lane Assist. There- fore, carefully read the information about
the ACC ››› page 180 and the Lane Assist
››› page 191 and take into account the limita-
tions of the systems and the indications given in the information.

How to know if the vehicle is fitted with Travel Assist
The vehicle is fitted with Travel Assist if the Travel Assist option appears when the but- ton on the multifunction steering wheel is pressed.

Speed range
Travel Assist regulates at speeds over 0 km/h (0 mph). The set speed can be adjusted at speeds over 20 km/h (15 mph).

Driving with Travel Assist
Travel Assist automatically controls the accel- erator pedal, the brakes and the steering.
In addition, Travel Assist may, within its limi- tations, decelerate the vehicle until it stops behind another that stops and automatically starts again.
You can override assisted adjustment at all times.

Status display

Control lamps indicate the status of the system on the instrument panel display:
Indicator lamp green: Travel Assist ac- tive, adaptive cruise control and adap- tive lane guidance function are active.
Partially green lamp: Travel Assist ac- tive, adaptive cruise control active and adaptive lane guidance function pas-
sive.
Grey lamp: Travel Assist deactivated, not regulating.

Driver intervention prompt
If you remove your hands from the steering wheel, after a few seconds the system asks you to take over the steering with an indication on the instrument panel display and acoustic warnings.
If you do not react, Travel Assist is deactivated.
Depending on the equipment, Emergency As- sist activates in its place.

Travel Assist with online data1)
Travel Assist with online data uses online map data to enhance its performance (depending on equipment and not available in all coun- tries).

This makes it possible to increase the availabil- ity of Travel Assist in certain driving situations,
e.g. when the road markings are incomplete or missing on one side of the road.
Requirements:
? Travel Assist is activated.
? Your CUPRA CONNECT subscription is acti- vated.
? You have an Internet connection.
? The use of online map data is activated.
? The upload function for all map data collec- ted from your vehicle is enabled (optional).

The Travel Assist function can be found in the menu together with the ACC and speed lim-
iter functions.
1. While driving with ACC activated, tap on the multifunction steering wheel to select the Travel Assist function.
The vehicle switches from ACC to Travel Assist.

Depending on the driving situation, the vehi- cle switches to the following system statuses in Travel Assist:
? If the ACC was already regulating, Travel As- sist maintains the current speed and the preset distance to the vehicle in front.

When lane markings are detected, the vehicle is also kept in the lane by steering movements.
? If ACC was not already regulating, Travel As- sist remains selected but in a passive status (not regulating).
Press the	button.
Travel Assist switches to the active system sta- tus, depending on the driving situation.
The indicator lamp for the driving situation lights up on the instrument cluster display. A message is also displayed.

Interrupting regulation
1. Briefly press the button  .
OR: press the brake pedal.
The set distance remains saved.

Switch to ACC or speed limiter
1. Press the button on the multi-function steering wheel.
The vehicle switches from Travel Assist to the ACC or speed limiter system status cor- responding to the driving situation.

Making other adjustments
All other aspects of Travel Assist are controlled like the ACC.

Using the lane change assist
Lane Change Assist uses the same sensor sys- tem as Side Assist. Therefore, read the infor-
mation on Side Assist ››› page 200 carefully
and observe the limits of the system and the notes that it displays.
Activating the convenience turn signal on a motorway, provided that the prerequisites are met and no vehicles have been detected in the vicinity, provides assistance when the vehicle is changing lanes.

Prerequisites
Lane change assist is only available, depend- ing on the vehicle's equipment, when driving forwards on multi-lane motorways included in the Infotainment system's navigation data, and when travelling faster than 90 km/h.
Travel Assist must also be activated.
The convenience turn signals mode must first be activated in the infotainment system's vehi-
cle settings menu ››› page 122.

? Grey: changing lanes to the respective side of the lane is not possible.
? White: Changing lanes is possible on the respective lane side.

According to the driving situation, the follow- ing symbols also light up in the instrument cluster:
Lane assist active, manoeuvre not avail- able.

Lane assist active, manoeuvre available (arrow direction highlighted).
Lane assist active, manoeuvre in execu- tion.

Activating and deactivating lane change as- sist
You can activate and deactivate lane change assist in the Infotainment system.
1. Access the assistant menu.
2. Select Travel Assist.
3. Activate or deactivate lane change assist as a sub-function of Travel Assist.


Activating lane change assist while driving
Once the prerequisites have been met and the programmed speed has been set with the button:
1. Press the	button again.
This activates the lane assist. The arrows of your own lane on the instrument cluster
display are grey ››› Fig. 132 2


197




Changing lanes
If the system detects no objects in the detec- tion field of the sensor system and an assisted lane change to an adjacent lane is possible, the corresponding lane is shown in the instrument cluster display next to the driver's own lane.
The arrow on the corresponding side of the lane is displayed in white ››› Fig. 132 2 .
1. When the convenience turn signal is ac- tivated on the desired side, the vehicle changes lane. A message is also displayed.
When changing lanes, the vehicle automati- cally activates the turn signal on the corre- sponding side. Once the lane change is com- plete, the turn signal automatically switches off.


Turning off the lane change assist
? It turns off if the steering wheel is turned sharply.
? OR: by pressing the  button.
? OR: by pressing the brake pedal. Lane change assist is deactivated.

Troubleshooting

     Travel Assist is not available or does not work as expected
The control lamp lights up in yellow. A relevant warning is also displayed on the instrument cluster display.
? There is a fault in the sensors. Check the causes and solutions described in the informa-
tion about the ACC ››› page 185 or the Lane Assist ››› page 193.
? There is a fault or a defect. Turn the drive system off and on again.
? The system limits are exceeded.
? If the problem persists, consult a specialised workshop. CUPRA recommends visiting a spe- cialised CUPRA dealer or any SEAT dealership.

? If the problem persists, consult a specialised workshop. CUPRA recommends visiting a spe- cialised CUPRA dealer or any SEAT dealership.

Regulation is interrupted unexpectedly
? Vehicles without lane departure warning:
You have turned on the turn signal.

     Assisted lane changing is interrupted or unavailable
A message about this is shown on the instru- ment cluster display.


198




? The vehicle has stopped detecting lane markings.
? You have let go of the steering wheel
? You are applying too much force to the steering wheel.
? You have turned on the turn signal too many times, or the turn signal lever is stuck.
? The driving speed is lower than around 85 km/h.
? The vehicle has detected objects in the vi- cinity that prevent an assisted lane change.
? You are not on a multi-lane motorway.

Emergency Assist
How it works
Emergency Assist can detect whether the driver is inactive and can automatically keep the car in its lane and stop it altogether if nec- essary. This way the system can actively help avoid an accident or reduce its consequences.
Emergency Assist uses the same sensors as Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and Lane As- sist Therefore, carefully read the information
about the ACC ››› page 180 and Lane Assist
››› page 191 and take into account the limita-
tions of the systems and the indications given in the information.

Emergency assist always available after the ig- nition has been switched on and is activated if the following conditions are met:
? Travel Assist or Lane Assist) is switched on.
? The system has detected at least one lane boundary to the left or right of the vehicle.

Driver intervention prompt
If the emergency assist detects that the driver is not actively doing anything, he or she is prompted to take control of the vehicle by audio warnings and a brief application of the brake. In addition, a warning is shown on the instrument cluster display and the volume of the infotainment system is lowered.
Depending on the equipment, the driver's seat belt is tightened at the same time.

System intervention
If the driver does not react, the system can brake the vehicle and keep it in its lane. The following control lamp lights up on the instru- ment cluster display:
The system is regulating, lane guidance is activated.

The system is regulating, passive lane guidance.

You can cancel the adjustment at any time by moving the steering wheel, over-accelerating or braking.
While the emergency assistant is in operation, other road users are warned as follows:
? The hazard warning lights are switched on soon after.
? The horn sounds (depending on the speed).
The following happens as soon as the vehicle stops:
? The electronic parking brake is activated.
? All doors are unlocked.
? The passenger compartment lighting comes on.
? Depending on the features, an emergency call (eCall) is made.





199




Troubleshooting

Emergency Assist not available
The control lamp lights up in yellow. A relevant warning is also displayed on the instrument cluster display.

Lane departure warning (Side Assist)
Introduction
The lane departure warning uses radar sen- sors to monitor the areas behind the vehicle
››› page 6. The system does this by measuring
the vehicle's distance from other vehicles and its speed differential. The lane departure warn- ing will not work at speeds of less than approx. 15 km/h (9 mph).
Lane width is not detected individually, but is rather pre-configured in the system. Thus if you are driving in wide lanes or in between two lanes, the indications may be incorrect.
Furthermore, the system can detect vehicles driving in the lane next to you (if there are any), and can also detect stationary objects such as dividers, and thus give an incorrect indication.

Trailer mode
Side assist is automatically deactivated and cannot be switched on if the factory-fitted tow-bar is electrically connected to a trailer or similar device.
As soon as the driver starts to drive with a trailer connected electrically to the vehicle, a message is displayed on the instrument cluster display indicating that side assist is switched off. Once the vehicle trailer has been disen- gaged, side assist will return to the initial state prior to the moment the trailer was electrically connected.
If the tow-bar is not factory fitted, side assist should be switched off manually when driving with a trailer.

Physical limitations inherent to the system
In some situations the lane departure warning may not interpret the traffic situation correctly.
I.e. in the following situations:
? on tight bends;
? in the case of lanes with different widths;
? in areas with significant gradient changes;
? in adverse weather conditions;
? in the case of special constructions to the side of the vehicle, e.g., high or irregular divid- ers.

Driving with Side Assist


Connecting and disconnecting
Side Assist can be switched on and off by ac- cessing the Assistants menu in the infotain- ment system.
When the lane departure warning is ready to operate, the indications in the control lamps will turn on briefly as confirmation.

The system is activated automatically when the ignition is switched on.

Indication on the exterior mirror
The control lamp provides an indication on the corresponding side regarding the traffic situa- tion behind the vehicle, if it is deemed to be critical. The control lamp on the left-hand side indicates the traffic situation to the rear left of the vehicle, and the control lamp on the right- hand side indicates the traffic situation to the rear right of the vehicle .
201




In the case of retrofitted tinted windows or windows with tinted film, the indications of the external mirrors may not be seen clearly.
Keep the external mirrors clean and free of snow and ice, and do not cover them with ad- hesives or other similar materials.

It lights up
It turns on once briefly: the lane departure warning is activated and ready to operate, i.e. when activating the system.
It lights up continuously: the lane departure warning has detected a vehicle in the blind spot.

Flashes
A vehicle has been detected in the adjacent lane and the turn signal has been engaged in the direction of the detected vehicle.
For vehicles that are also equipped with Lane Assist ››› page 191, a warning to switch lanes
will also appear even though the turn signal has not been engaged (Lane Assist "Plus").

The control lamps light up when the ignition is switched on and should turn off after approxi- mately 2 seconds. This is the time taken for the function check.

If there are no indications from the control lamp of the lane departure warning, this means that the lane departure warning has not detec- ted any other vehicles at the rear area.
When the exterior lighting is low, the intensity with which the control lamps come on is dim- med. The user can modify the intensity of the control lamps with up to 5 levels in the infotain- ment system menu.

Lane assist Plus.
The Lane Assist Plus function can be used by activating the Lane Assist ››› page 191 and
Side Assist functions. In this case its functions are expanded as described below.
If the driver initiates a lane change manoeuvre in a potential critical situation:
? The lamp flashes in the corresponding rear- view mirror even though the turn signal has not been activated.
? The steering wheel vibrates to warn the driver of the risk of collision.
? torque is applied to correct the steering and return the vehicle to its lane.

Driving situations








Fig. 135 Overtaking with traffic behind the vehicle.







In the following situations, an indication will be displayed by the control lamp ››› Fig. 133 ,
››› Fig. 134 (arrow):

Lane departure warning (Side Assist)

? When being overtaken by another vehicle
››› Fig. 135.
? When overtaking another vehicle
››› Fig. 136 with a speed difference of approx.
10 km/h (6 mph). If the vehicle is passing at
a considerably higher speed, no indication will be displayed.
The faster the vehicle approaches, the sooner an indication will be displayed in the control lamp, because the lane departure warning takes into account the speed differential with other vehicles. Thus even though the distance from the other vehicle is identical, the indica- tion will appear sooner in some cases and later in others.

General information on parking systems
Automatic brake operation
The automatic braking feature of a parking sys- tem is used to reduce the danger of collision when an obstacle is detected during a parking manoeuvre.

Braking functions
Depending on the equipment, the following systems are available:
? Park assist plus manoeuvre braking function
››› page 209.
? Rear cross traffic alert emergency brake function ››› page 231.
? Automatic parking assistant emergency brake function ››› page 213.

Infotainment system lamps
White lamp: system activated, the sys- tem brakes when it detects an obstacle in the path.
Coloured lamp: system deactivated, the system does not brake when it detects an obstacle although the sensors still
detect it.

Requirements
? The vehicle is moving between approx. 3 km/h and 8 km/h when manoeuvring
? A parking system is switched on.
The brakes are not automatically operated when park assist is switched on automatically while moving forward.

What happens in the event of automatic braking?
If there is an obstacle, the system brakes the vehicle to a standstill and keeps it stationary for approx. 2 seconds. Press the brake!

Activate
? Automatic braking is activated when the driver switches a parking system on.

Deactivating
? The automatic brake operation function de- activates when a park assist system is switched off.
? OR: to temporarily deactivate the manoeu- vre braking function, press the	function button on the park assist screen and change the setting.



208




Troubleshooting
The parking system behaves differently than expected
There can be several causes:
? The system requirements are not met.
? The sensors or the camera are dirty or have ice on them ››› page 348.
? The camera lens is not clean and the camera image is not clear ››› page 348.
? Some noise sources, such as a jackhammer or a cobblestone surface can interfere with the ultrasound signal.
? The vehicle has some type of damage in the sensor or camera area, e.g. due to a parking impact.
? The sensor detection zone or field of view of the camera are blocked by an accessory, e.g. a bike rack.
? Changes have been made to the paintwork or structural modifications in the sensor or camera area, e.g. at the front of the vehicle or to the running gear.
Also take into account the messages displayed on the infotainment system display.

Sensor or camera without visibility, or the parking system has been switched off
If a sensor fails, that sensor zone is perma- nently switched off. The affected sensor zone may be displayed on the infotainment system

with a symbol and a greyed-out graphic segment. If necessary, the parking system switches off the affected zone.
If the park assist is not working properly, a continuous audible signal sounds for a few seconds when it is switched on. If applicable, a message to this effect is displayed on the instrument cluster display
? Check if one of the causes indicated above has occurred.
? Once the source of the problem has been eliminated, the system may be reconnected.
? If the problem persists, consult a specialised workshop.

Park Distance Control Plus (Park Pilot)
Description








Parking aid plus assists the driver by giving visual and audio warnings about obstacles de- tected in front of and behind the vehicle.
The bumpers are fitted with sensors. When an obstacle is detected, it is indicated by au- dible signals and in the Infotainment system
››› Fig. 138.
When moving close to an obstacle, it is possi- ble to know if the obstacle is in front of the vehicle or behind it according to the sound frequency.


209




The approximate measurement range of the sensors is:
A 1.20 m
B  0.90 m
C  1.60 m
D  0.90 m

As you approach the obstacle, the frequency of the audible signals will increase. The signal will sound continuously at around 0.30 m: Stop the vehicle!

If the separation is maintained, the volume of the warning starts to decrease after about 2.5 seconds and for the next 2.5 seconds it is fades away until disappearing completely.

Error messages
If a an error or fault message is displayed on the instrument cluster in Park Assist, there is a fault.
If the fault doesn't disappear before discon- necting the ignition, it will not be indicated next time the parking aid is connected.
If a rear sensor is faulty, only the obstacles in the front area are detected. If a front sensor is faulty, only the obstacles in the rear area are displayed. The symbol is displayed.
We recommend taking the vehicle to a special- ised workshop to have the fault repaired.

Trailer mode
On vehicles with a factory-mounted trailer hook, when the trailer is connected, the rear sensors will not activate when reverse gear is engaged or button  is pressed in the Infotain- ment system ( > Assistants). Therefore, any objects behind or to the side of the vehicle will not be indicated on the screen and no audio signals will sound.
The screen will only display objects detected at the front, and the vehicle's trajectory will be hidden.

Parking assist settings
The indications and audible signals are set in the Infotainment system: function button	> Assistants > Parking >	> Settings.
? Automatic activation: On/off
? Front volume: Volume in the front and rear area.
? Rear volume: Volume in the rear area.
? Reduce volume: When the parking aid is switched on, the volume of the audio source will be reduced, depending on the selected option.



210




Operating Park Assist Plus
Switching on and off manually
? Press button  in the infotainment system (  > Assistants > Parking assist > Parking aid).

Automatic activation
? Select reverse gear.
? OR: if you drive forward at a speed of less than 15 km/h (9 mph) and you encounter an obstacle, it is detected when it is optically ap- prox. less than 95 cm. away, or acoustically ap- prox. 50 cm. away. If the automatic connection is activated, a reduced display is shown.
? OR: if the vehicle moves back a certain dis- tance (between approx. 10 and 20 cm approx depending on whether or not an obstacle is detected).
When the Plus Parking Aid connects auto- matically, a diagram of the vehicle and the seg- ments will appear on screen. This function will be available unless the user has deactivated it.
It only operates every time the speed drops below 15 km/h (9 mph) for the first time.

211




Automatic activation of park assist can be switched on and off in the infotainment sys- tem:
? Switch the ignition on.
? In the infotainment system select	> Assis- tants > Parking > Parking aid.
? Check the Automatic activation box.
If activated automatically, an audible sound warning will only be given when obstacles in front are at a distance of less than 50 cm. ap- prox.
If it is switched off using the  button in the infotainment system, one of the following ac- tions must be taken for it to reactivate auto- matically:
? Switch off the ignition and switch it on again.
? EITHER: drive forward at over approx. 15 km/h (9 mph).
? OR: switch the automatic activation on and off in the Infotainment system.

Automatic disconnection
? Drive forward at 15 km/h (9 mph) or faster.

Temporary sound suppression
? Press the	function button on the infotain- ment screen.
? OR: activate the electronic parking brake.

Change from reduced view to full view
? Engage the reverse gear if your vehicle is equipped with a reversing camera.
? Press the car icon on the reduced view
? OR: if the vehicle moves back a certain dis- tance (between approx. 10 and 20 cm approx depending on whether or not an obstacle is detected).

Switch to the reverse assist image (Rear View Camera)
? Select reverse gear.
? OR: tap the	button on the Infotainment System screen.
A short confirmation signal will be heard and the button symbol will light up when the sys- tem is switched on.



Visual indication segments








The optical indication of the segments works as follows:
? Grey segments: the obstacle is more than approx. 30 cm away from the path or in the direction opposite to travel. They are also dis- played when the electronic parking brake is ac- tivated.
? Yellow segments: the obstacles lie on the vehicle's path and are at a distance of less than approx. 30 cm away.
? Red segments: obstacles are less than ap- prox. 30 cm away.
A guiding track will indicate the anticipated for- ward or backward trajectory, depending on the gear that is engaged.
If an obstacle is located in the vehicle's way, the corresponding audible warning will sound.


212




When the penultimate segment is displayed, the vehicle has reached the collision zone. In the collision zone, obstacles are shown in red (including those outside the trajectory). Stop
the vehicle! ›››	in Description on page 210

Intelligent Park Assist (IPA) automatic parking system
Introduction
The automatic parking system is an additional function of ParkPilot ››› page 209 and helps
the driver find a suitable parking space from among the following types:
? reverse parking in suitable perpendicular and parallel spaces,
? park driving forwards in suitable perpendicu- lar spaces,
? exit a parking space driving forwards from a parallel space,
? park in a suitable space driving forwards at an angle to partially enter the selected parking space. The system will centre the vehicle in the parking space,
? finish reverse parking into a space in which you have attempted to park manually by parti- ally entering with the rear of the vehicle.

In vehicles with an automatic parking system and factory infotainment system, the front, rear and side areas are represented, and the position of obstacles is shown relative to the vehicle.
The automatic parking system is subject to certain limitations inherent to the system and its use requires special attention by the
driver ›››  .



213


? Keep a distance between 0.5 and 2.0 metres
when driving past the parking space.
? Space length (parallel parking): vehicle length + 1 meter.
? Space width (parking bay): vehicle width
+ 1.1 meters.

Requirements for leaving the parking space (only for parallel parking)
? The traction control (TCS) must be switched on ››› page 168.
? 






Description of the automatic park- ing system
The components of the automatic parking system are the ultrasonic sensors located in the front and rear bumpers, the	button to switch the system on and off and the messages on the infotainment system display.

Prerequisites for parking
? The traction control (TCS) must be switched on ››› page 168.
? Speed when passing next to the parking space: do not exceed approx. 50 km/h (31 mph).

Space length: length of the vehicle
+ 0.5 metres.

Prematurely stopping or automatically inter- rupting the manoeuvres for parking or exit- ing a parking space
The automatic parking system interrupts the manoeuvres for parking or exiting a parking space in any of the following cases:
? Press button	in the infotainment system,
   > Assistants > Parking > Automatic park- ing system.
? The driver takes control of the steering wheel.
? The parking manoeuvre can involve up to 8 movements.
? The parking manoeuvre does not end within 6 minutes after activation of the automatic steering.


214




? There is a fault in the system (the system is temporarily unavailable).
? TCS is switched off.
? TCS or ESC intervene with regulation.
? A door or the luggage compartment is opened.
? The parking system encounters an unexpec- ted obstacle.
? The parking system detects high rolling re- sistance, e.g. if there is an obstacle on the ground (stone, bump, kerb, etc.).

Special characteristics
The automatic parking system is subject to certain limitations inherent to the system. For example, it is therefore not possible to use it to enter or exit a parking space on sharp bends or on very steep hills.

After changing a wheel
If, after changing a wheel, the vehicle stops entering and exiting parking spaces correctly, the circumference of the new wheel may be different and the system may need to adapt to it. The adaptation is automatic and takes
place during driving ›››	in Introduction on
page 213.

Selecting a parking type










Automatic parking includes the following 5 types of parking:
Reverse parallel parking. Reverse angle parking. Forward angle parking.
Reverse parallel parking without driving past first: "Help me".
Forward or reverse parking in a parking bay without driving past first.

Selecting a parking type after passing in front of the space
After activating the automatic parking system and after detecting a parking space, the info- tainment system display proposes a type of parking. The automatic parking system selects the parking type automatically. The selected type is shown on the infotainment system dis- play is shown on the instrument panel display
››› Fig. 140.
? The prerequisites for parking with the automatic parking system must be met
››› page 214.
? Press the	button in the infotainment sys- tem,	> Assistants.
? When the system is switched on, the symbol on the infotainment system display is high-

Automatic Parking System Plus with memory func- tion
Introduction
The Automatic Parking System Plus with mem- ory function offers assistance when parking in frequently used parking spaces. The vehicle automatically manoeuvres along a previously saved route to the parking space.
The availability of the Automatic Parking Sys- tem Plus with memory function depends on the vehicle's equipment.

How it works
The Automatic Parking System Plus with mem- ory function is an extension of the Automatic Parking System.
This parking system uses the front camera to detect the surrounding area and saves the route to the parking space, with a maximum distance of 50m. Once the parking process
is saved in the Assistant, the vehicle is able to reach the parking space automatically.

The driver must monitor the area around the vehicle at all times ››› .
Automatic braking may occur if there are ob- stacles in the vehicle's path or if a dangerous situation arises.

Prerequisites
? GPS coordinates of the vehicle's position are available.
? Sufficient space for manoeuvring. The vehi- cle may have to travel a few meters to reach the programmed parking route.

Peripheral view system (Top View Camera)
Introduction
Using 4 cameras, the system generates a rep- resentation that is shown on the infotainment system display. The cameras are located on the radiator grille, the exterior mirrors and the rear lid.
The functions and representations of the Area View system may vary depending on whether or not the vehicle has ParkPilot.


Area View system





There are four different views to choose from
››› Fig. 150:

B Right camera area
C Rear camera area
D Left camera area

Function buttons:
Depending on the equipment: connect- ing and disconnecting the ParkPilot sound.

The aerial view is generated by combining the images from all the cameras	››› Fig. 150.
The top view can be selected by pressing the vehicle inside the zone.
The system will automatically switch between front and rear camera view according to the direction of travel.
Press on the different areas ››› Fig. 150 A to
 D of the top view or reduced top view to select and set the corresponding view, which will be highlighted in orange.

Conditions necessary for the use of the Area View system
? The doors and the rear lid must be closed.
? The image must be reliable and clear. For this reason, for example, the camera lens must be clean.
? The area around the vehicle must be clearly and totally visible.
? The area for parking or manoeuvring should be a flat surface.
? 
The vehicle should not be loaded very heav- ily at the rear.
? The driver must be used to the system.
? There should be no damage to the vehicle in the camera area. If the position or installation angle of the cameras have been changed, e.g. after a rear-end collision, the system should be checked by a specialised workshop.

Special characteristics
The images on the area view system cameras are only two-dimensional. Due to a lack of spa- tial depth, it is difficult or impossible to make out on-screen any holes there may be on the ground, objects jutting out from the ground or parts protruding from other vehicles.
Situations in which the objects or other vehi- cles appear to be further away or closer than they really are:
? On moving from a horizontal plane to a slope.
? On moving from a slope to a horizontal plane.
? If the vehicle is heavily loaded at the rear.
? If the vehicle approaches protruding objects. These objects may be outside the cameras' angle of visibility.

Trailer mode
The Area View system conceals, in the rear camera area, all the auxiliary guiding lines when the factory-fitted towing bracket is con-
nected electrically to a trailer ››› page 294.


Connecting and disconnecting
Connecting
? Select reverse gear.
? OR: in the infotainment system select	> Assistants > Parking assistant > Park assist
.

Switching off
? Drive forward at a speed of at least 15 km/h (9 mph).

Cross traffic.
This visualization helps to monitor traffic to the left, front and right of the vehicle and can be used, for example, when ex-
iting garages or narrow exits.

Rear Cross Traffic Alert)
How it works








Park Assist uses the radar sensors on the rear bumper ››› page 172 to monitor traffic cross-
ing behind the vehicle as it reverses out of a parking bay, or as it is being manoeuvred, for example in very low visibility conditions.
When the system detects a relevant vehicle on the road that is approaching the rear of the ve-
hicle ››› Fig. 151, an acoustic alarm may sound
if the relevance so requires it.
In addition to the acoustic alarm, the driver is also informed by means of a visual signal on infotainment system display. This signal is dis- played in the form of a red strip at the back of



231




the image of the vehicle on the infotainment system screen. This strip displays the side of the vehicle towards which traffic is approach-
ing in transverse direction1).

Automatic braking to reduce damages
››› page 208.
Connecting and disconnecting
The rear cross traffic alert can be activated and deactivated by accessing the Assistants menu of the infotainment system. It can also be found in the Park Assist Settings menu.
When the vehicle is restarted, the last adjust- ment in the system will remain active.

Trailer mode
The rear cross traffic alert will be automatically deactivated and it will be impossible to activate them if the tow hitch is electrically connected to a trailer or other similar object. As soon as the driver starts driving, a message appears on the instrument cluster screen indicating that the assistant is deactivated.
Once the trailer is uncoupled from the vehicle, the assistant will return to its initial state prior to the moment when the trailer was electrically connected.

If the tow hitch is not factory fitted, then the rear cross traffic alert will have to be deactiva- ted manually when driving with a trailer.

Exit Warning
How it works



















1) It is only displayed if the vehicle is equipped with a parking system.
232




The door opening warning (Exit Warning) warns occupants of a possible collision when opening the door when the vehicle is station- ary.
The system monitors, within the limits of the system itself, the rear and side environ- ment of the vehicle using the rear sensors
››› page 172. It detects moving objects
that approach from behind, such as cars
››› Fig. 152.
If a critical situation is detected when the door is opened, an alert is given by an audible signal from the door speaker on the corresponding
side ››› Fig. 153. The side assist control lamp
on the side of the corresponding door will also flash. If the door has already been opened
or remains closed but the electronic parking brake P is engaged, the indicator lamp lights up continuously when a critical situation is detec- ted on the corresponding side.
The brightness of the door opening assistant display can be adjusted by accessing the Side Assist menu.

When you want to access the vehicle for the first time, with the doors closed and locked, the function will be available 3 minutes after the first opening of any of the doors. The func- tion will continue to be available as long as the vehicle has the ignition connected and is not moving.

After switching off the ignition, the function will remain available for approximately 3 minutes. After that time, the control lamps will light up indicating the deactivation of the function.

Connecting and disconnecting
The door opening assistant can be switched on and off by accessing the Assistants menu in the infotainment system. It can also be found in the Park Assist Settings menu.

The system is activated automatically when the ignition is switched on.

Trailer mode
The door opening assistant will be automati- cally deactivated and it will be impossible to activate it if the tow hitch is electrically con- nected to a trailer or other similar object.
Once the trailer is uncoupled from the vehicle, the assistant will return to its initial state prior to the moment when the trailer was electrically connected.
If the tow hitch is not factory fitted, then the door opening assistant will have to be deacti- vated manually when driving with a trailer.

Data transmissions
Cybersecurity
Introduction
What is cybersecurity?
Cybersecurity refers to measures that reduce the risk of unauthorised access to vehicle functions, data and control units via malware or an attack over the Internet.

What are connectivity components?
Control units for data transmissions, interfaces and media and diagnostic connections are connectivity components through which data and information can be exchanged between the vehicle and external devices or the Inter- net. Connectivity components that are not part of the equipment of all of the vehicles particularly include:
? Connection socket for diagnosis.
? Control unit with an integrated eSIM card (OCU).
? Telephone interface.
? Full Link.
? NFC wireless communication technology.
? Bluetooth Interface(r).
? USB (connection).
? Transreceiver module.

The connectivity components are key points
in cybersecurity. Connectivity components are also fitted with security mechanisms that min- imise the risk of unauthorised third parties gaining access to vehicle systems.

Security mechanisms
Software and locking mechanisms mounted on the vehicle are being developed continuously. As in the case of computers or mobile phone device operating systems, software and lock- ing mechanisms mounted on the vehicle can also be updated non-periodically. In general, software updates improve the security, stability and speed of execution of vehicle systems that have already been manufactured.

Minimising risks
You can contribute to reducing the risk of un- authorized third parties accessing the vehicle systems and their functions:
? Do not use data storage devices, Bluetooth(r) devices or mobile phone devices that contain manipulated data or malicious software in the vehicle.
? Immediately install the system updates provi- ded by CUPRA.
? Only get vehicle repair and maintenance work done at specialised workshops. CUPRA recommends visiting a CUPRA dealership for this purpose.


237

Car2X communication
Introduction

How Car2X works1)
Car2X enables communication between sev- eral vehicles, as well as between vehicles and the road infrastructure (hereinafter referred to as "participants") in the vicinity. Communica- tion between the participants is established
in accordance with Car2X and WLAN (Wi-
Fi) standards, regardless of the manufacturer. Car2X only works in some countries.
When Car2X is connected, data are transmit- ted permanently between the participants, re- gardless of whether their vehicles are in online or offline mode.
To prevent misuse and to sign Car2X data with changing IDs, Car2X data transmitters must have valid certificates. This means that each of the recipients can check that the Car2X data are authentic and that they come from a legiti- mate participant.
The vehicle's own certificates can only be re- newed automatically in online mode.
To update the Car2X certificates to ensure that Car2X remains active, activate the Online mode in the vehicle at least once a month.

Continuously changing provisional Car2X data IDs minimises the probability that the data that is sent can be linked to you personally.

Meaning of the symbol
Indicates that the connected Car2X also sends and receives data in Offline mode.

Data transmissions
When Car2X is connected, the following data are sent and received via the Car2X antennas:
? Vehicle data such as speed.
? Position data.
? Data about incidents, e.g. accidents.

Car2X distinguishing element
If you can switch on Car2X communication in Privacy settings in the infotainment system, this means that the vehicle is fitted with Car2X technology.




1) Not available in all markets.
240




Car2X limits
Data exchange
Your vehicle's Car2X only communicates with those participants that are equipped with compatible and operational Car2X technology.
Participants with deactivated, faulty or non- compatible Car2X are not picked up.

Range
Depending on weather conditions and the sur- roundings, Car2X participants can communi- cate within a range of up to approx. 800m. Not all Car2X-based functions use the full possible range.

Limited operation
Car2X operations may be limited in the follow- ing cases:
? Environmental conditions prevent the partic- ipant from receiving data.
? The use of a trailer or accessories added to the vehicle may prevent the participant from receiving data.
? The incident in question is not picked up as such by participants.




Switching Car2X on and off
Connecting
? Access the Privacy settings menu.
? Activate Car2X.

Manual disconnection
? Access the Privacy settings menu.
? Disconnect Car2X.

Automatic disconnection
Car2X may switch off automatically in some ca- ses ››› page 243, Troubleshooting. Once the
reason that it switched off automatically has been rectified, Car2X will reconnect automati- cally.

Local hazard warning
























242

The local hazard warning uses the connected Car2X and gives warnings, depending on the situation, of hazard points in the surrounding area. This can prevent accidents and improve traffic flow.

Hazard points send data
When other participants receive Car2X data, you may be warned of the following hazard points:
Accident ahead.

Emergency vehicle attending. This warn- ing is supplemented by a symbol indicat- ing the direction from which the emer-
gency vehicle is approaching.

Direction from which the emergency service vehicle is approaching, e.g. from the rear.
End of queue ahead.

Intervention of an assistance system on a vehicle that is ahead.
Stopped or broken down vehicle ahead. Works ahead.
Oncoming driver. Reduced visibility.

People on the road. Animals on the road. Obstacle on the road.
Slow moving vehicle in front. Strong wind.
Slippery road surface.




Display of a local hazard warning
Depending on the type of hazard, speed and the vehicle's deceleration, a warning will be given of a significant hazard as follows:
? Audio warning.
? Information or warning message (symbol in yellow or red depending on the proximity of the hazard).

Traffic hazard alert setting options
Activating and deactivating the traffic hazard alert:
? Select: Assistants > Traffic hazard alert > Activate.
You can adjust the settings to receive warnings only for critical hazards. To do this, you must deactivate warnings with an advance warning level.
? Select: Assistants > Traffic hazard alert > Advance warning level.

Hide the displayed hazard warning
Press the button on the multifunction steer- ing wheel.




Troubleshooting
Car2X switches off automatically
? Car2X is not allowed in the country you are driving in.
? The vehicle has been offline for a long time and therefore the certificates have not been updated. Configure the privacy settings so that an Internet connection is established and cer- tificates can be updated.
? There is a fault in the system. Contact a spe- cialised workshop.

No Car2X data is displayed
? Car2X has limited operation.
? There are no participants sending data in the surrounding area.
? There are participants sending data in the surrounding area, but they are not relevant to your vehicle.
? The Car2X antennas are blocked by accesso- ries or parts that cover them. Keep the area surrounding the Car2X antennas free of obsta- cles.
? 
Data exchange between participants is re- duced or impossible due to weather condi- tions.
? The driver has already reacted to the hazard- ous situation ahead.

Legal provisions
When using CUPRA CONNECT services, infor- mation is transferred and processed online through the vehicle. Such data can also pro- vide (at least indirectly) information about the driver in question, for example, driving behav- iour and location. As a contracting party in the CUPRA CONNECT contract with SEAT, S.A., you must ensure that when your vehicle is used by other drivers (for example, family or friends), data protection and personal rights are respected. Therefore, you must inform drivers in advance that the vehicle transfers and receives data online, and that you can ac- cess such data.
Failure to take this obligation to inform into ac- count can infringe certain rights of the occu- pants.

Personal information
CUPRA protects your personal data and only uses them as permitted by law, or if you have given your consent to a certain use. Detailed information on data processing in connection with the CUPRA CONNECT services can be found in the Data Protection Declaration, the current version of which can be accessed on the CUPRA website.

Permanent transfer of the vehicle
If the vehicle has been purchased used or someone else has left the vehicle to you
for permanent use, CUPRA CONNECT may al- ready be activated and the previous primary user may still be able to access the data regis- tered via CUPRA CONNECT and control certain functions of your vehicle.
You can automatically remove the previous pri- mary user by registering yourself as the primary user of the vehicle. Alternatively, you can re- store the infotainment system to factory set- tings (  > Restore factory settings) or set the
vehicle to offline mode (››› page 247) and
therefore limit both your vehicle's communica- tion with the CUPRA data service and the pro- cessing of personal and vehicle data.

Deactivating CUPRA CONNECT services
The following functions are available to ac- tivate and deactivate the CUPRA CONNECT services:
? Allow or prevent data transmissions through the infotainment system ››› page 247, Pri- vacy mode.
? Wherever possible: individual deactivation or activation through your user account in the My CUPRA App.
You can run the relevant services again after cancelling their deactivation.




Faults
Even if the prerequisites for the use of CUPRA CONNECT services are met, there may be fac- tors beyond the control of CUPRA that inter- fere with the execution of such services or pre- vent them. specifically including:
? Maintenance, repair, deactivation, software update and technical expansion of telecom- munication equipment, satellites, servers and data banks.
? Change of the mobile telephony standard for mobile data transmission by the telecommuni- cations service provider, e.g. from LTE or UMTS to EDGE or GPRS.
? Disconnection of an existing mobile phone standard by the telecommunications service provider.

General instructions for use
Operating indications
? The infotainment needs a few seconds for the complete start-up of the system and dur- ing that time it does not react to inputs. Only the image of the rear view camera system can be displayed during system start-up.
? The display of all indications and the execu- tion of functions only takes place once the in- fotainment system has finished booting. The duration of the system booting depends on the number of infotainment functions and may take longer than normal in the event of very high or very low temperatures.
? When using the infotainment system and corresponding accessories, e.g., headphones, bear in mind country-specific regulations and legal provisions.
? The online navigation, online voice com- mand and Internet Radio functions (among others) require the activation of CUPRA CON- NECT Gen4 services (linked to the CUPRA CONNECT PLUS pack) and an Internet con- nection for the vehicle. The data transmission must not be limited to perform the functions.
? To use the infotainment system, simply lightly press a button or touch the screen.
? 
For the correct operation of the infotain- ment system it is important that it is switched on and that, if necessary, the time and date of the vehicle are set correctly.
? If a function button is missing on the screen, it is not a device defect, but corresponds to the specific equipment of the country or version.
? Some infotainment functions can only be se- lected when the vehicle is at a standstill. In some countries, the gear selector must also be in parking position P or neutral N. This is not
a malfunction, but is due to compliance with legal requirements.
? Restrictions on the use of devices using Bluetooth(r) technology may apply in some countries. For further information, contact the local authorities.
? If you disconnect the 12-volt battery, turn on the ignition before restarting the infotainment system.
? If the setup is changed, this may change the display on the screen and in some cases, the infotainment system may behave in a manner different to that described in this instruction manual.
? When the drive system is switched off and the charge level of the vehicle's 12 V battery is low, the infotainment system switches off auto- matically.
? Ensure that any repairs or modifications that need to be carried out on the infotainment system are carried out by a specialised work-

shop. To do so, CUPRA recommends going to a specialised CUPRA dealer or any SEAT dealer- ship.
? Using a mobile phone device inside the vehi- cle may cause noise in the speakers.
? On vehicles with park assist, the audio source volume is automatically lowered when reverse gear is selected. The volume reduction can be adjusted.
? Information about the included software and the license conditions can be found in Set- tings > Information > Copyright.
? When selling or lending the vehicle, make sure that all saved data, files and settings have been deleted and, if necessary, external audio sources and data media have been removed. Remember to also restore the factory settings to unlink your CUPRA ID username from the vehicle, as well as your CUPRA CONNECT Gen4 pack.

Navigation
Introduction





A global satellite system determines the cur- rent position of the vehicle and the sensors mounted on the vehicle analyse the routes taken. All measured values and possible traffic events are compared with the available maps to allow optimal navigation to the destination.
Navigation announcements and graphic repre- sentations will guide you to your destination.
Navigation is managed on the screen.

Depending on the country, some functions of the infotainment system will not be available on the screen when travelling above a certain speed. It is not a malfunction, but is due to compliance with legislation.

Navigation announcements
Navigation announcements audible indica- tions for driving relating to the current route.
The type and frequency of navigation an- nouncements depend on the driving situation, for example, starting the guide to the destina- tion, driving on the motorway or on a round- about and the settings.

If the exact destination cannot be reached be- cause, for example, it is in a non-digitised area, indications relating to the address and the dis- tance to the destination are displayed on the screen.
During dynamic route guidance, you will re- ceive information about reported traffic con- gestion on the route. An additional navigation announcement is given if the route is recalcu- lated due to traffic congestion.
While a navigation announcement is playing, its volume can be adjusted. Subsequent navi- gation announcements will be played with the newly adjusted volume.


273




Limitations during navigation
If the infotainment system cannot receive data from GPS satellites, for example, in a tunnel or in an underground garage, navigation contin- ues using the vehicle's sensors.
In areas that are not digitised or are only parti- ally digitised in the infotainment's memory, the infotainment system will still attempt to provide route guidance.
In the case of missing or incomplete navigation data, it may not be possible to determine the exact position of the vehicle. This may mean that navigation is not as precise as usual.
Roads and streets are subject to constant change (e.g. new roads, road works, roads closed to traffic, changes to street names and building numbers). If the navigation data is ob- solete, this may lead to errors or inaccuracies during route guidance.

Navigation data
The Infotainment system is equipped with a built-in navigation data memory. Depending on the country, the necessary navigation data may already be pre-installed.
To provide correct route guidance and make the most of the functions offered, the infotain- ment system should be updated on a regular basis.
Using obsolete data may lead to errors during navigation. Current routes cannot be traced or the route guidances will lead to mistaken desti- nations.
Ensure navigation data is updated at all times.

Online updating of navigation data1)
The navigation data of the regions through which you travel frequently is automatically up- dated in the background if the Internet con- nection is established and the privacy settings are valid.
? With the ignition switched on, the navigation data is updated automatically.

Roof carrier
Introduction
The vehicle roof has been designed to opti- mise aerodynamics. For this reason, cross bars or conventional roof carrier systems cannot be secured to the roof water drains.
As the roof water drains are integrated in the roof to reduce air resistance, only CUPRA-ap- proved cross bars and roof carrier systems can be used.


On the rear seat, behind the central armrest, there is a trapdoor for transporting long items in the interior, such as skis.

292




Cases in which cross bars and the roof car- rier system should be disassembled.
? When they are not used.
? When the vehicle is washed in a car wash.
? When the vehicle height exceeds the maxi- mum height, for example, in some garages.












Securing the crossbars and the roof carrier system

boats on the roof. The appropriate accessories can be purchased at specialised CUPRA deal- ers or any SEAT dealership.
Always secure the crossbars and the roof car- rier system properly. Always take the assem- bly instructions that come with the crossbars and the roof carrier system in question into account.

Installing the bars
The front and rear attachment points 1 and
2 are only visible when the doors are open
››› Fig. 174.










The crossbars are the basis of a series of spe- cial roof carrier systems. For safety reasons, special fixtures must be used to safely trans- port luggage, bicycles, skis, surf boards or

293







Loading the roof carrier system
The load can only be secured if the crossbars and the roof carrier system are properly instal-
led ›››  .
Maximum authorised cargo on the roof
The maximum permissible roof load is 75 kg. This figure comes from the combined weight of the roof carrier, the cross bars and the load
itself on the roof ›››  .
Always check the weight of the roof carrier sys- tem (roof box, bicycle carrier, ski rack, etc.), of the cross bars and of the load to be transpor- ted and weigh them if necessary. Never exceed the maximum authorised roof load.
If you are using cross bars and a roof carrier with a lower weight rating, you will not be able to carry the maximum authorised roof load. In this case, do not exceed the maximum weight limit for the roof carrier which is listed in the fitting instructions.

Distributing a load
Distribute loads uniformly and secure them correctly ››› .

Check attachments
Once the cross bars and roof carrier system have been installed, check the bolted connec- tions and attachments after a short journey and every so often afterwards (approx. every 200 km).





Trailer mode
Introduction
Take into account country-specific regulations about driving with a trailer and the use of a towing bracket.
The vehicle has been developed primarily for carrying people, although it can also be used to tow a trailer if fitted with the corresponding technical equipment. This additional load has an effect on the useful life, fuel consumption and vehicle performance and in some cases can reduce the service intervals.
Driving with a trailer requires more force from the vehicle, and thus more concentration from the driver.
In winter, winter tyres should be fitted on both the vehicle and the trailer.

Maximum vertical load technically permitted on the coupling device
The maximum vertical load technically permit- ted from the trailer draw bar on the towing bracket's tow ball is 80 kg.

Vehicles with driving profile selection
If you are going to be towing a trailer, the use of the Eco driving profile is not recommended. You are advised to select another of the avail- able driving profiles before beginning to drive with a trailer.


294



Trailer weight/drawbar load
Never exceed the authorised trailer weight. If you do not load the trailer up to the maximum permitted trailer weight, you can then climb correspondingly steeper slopes.
The maximum trailer weights listed are only applicable for altitudes up to 1000 m above sea level. Since higher altitude decreases en- gine performance and the ability to climb slopes, the tow load decreases proportionally. The weight of the vehicle and trailer combina- tion must be reduced by 10% for every 1000 m of altitude. When possible, operate the trailer with the maximum authorised drawbar load on the ball joint of the towing bracket, but do not exceed the specified limit.




295




Technical requirements
Vehicles that are factory-equipped with a tow- ing bracket meet all the technical and legal re- quirements for driving with a trailer.
If the vehicle is retrofitted with a tow bracket, only a bracket that is authorised for the maxi- mum authorised load of the trailer that is to
be towed may be fitted. The towing bracket must be suitable for the vehicle and the trailer and must be properly secured to the vehicle's chassis. Only use a towing bracket that has been authorised by CUPRA for this vehicle. Al- ways check and take into account the towing bracket manufacturer's instructions.

Towing bracket fitted on the bumper
Never fit a towing bracket to the bumper or to the area where the bumper is mounted. The towing bracket should not impair the bumper's function. Do not make modifications or repairs to the exhaust system or the brake system.
Make regular checks to ensure that the towing bracket is secure.

Engine cooling system
Driving with a trailer increases the load on the engine and cooling system. The cooling system should have sufficient coolant and be prepared for the additional effort involved in driving with a trailer.

Trailer brakes
If the trailer has its own brake system, please take the relevant legal requirements into ac- count. Never connect the trailer's brake system to the vehicle's brake system.

Tow cable
Always fit a cable between the vehicle and the trailer ››› page 297.

Trailer tail lights
The trailer's tail lights should comply with the statutory safety regulations ››› page 297.
Never connect the trailer's tail lights directly to the vehicle's electric system. If you are not sure that the trailer's electrical connection is
correct, have it checked by a specialised work- shop. CUPRA recommends going to a special- ised CUPRA dealer or any SEAT dealership for this purpose.

Exterior mirrors
If you cannot see the area behind the trailer with the exterior mirrors of the towing vehicle, additional mirrors will have to be installed in accordance with the regulations of the coun- try in question. The exterior mirrors should be adjusted before you start driving and must pro- vide a sufficient field of vision at the rear.

When the vehicle is locked, the alarm is trig- gered if the electrical connection with the trailer is cut off.
Before hitching or unhitching a trailer, always turn off the anti-theft alarm. Otherwise, the tilt sensor could cause the alarm to go off.

Trailers with LED tail lights
For technical reasons, trailers fitted with LED rear lights cannot be connected to the anti- theft alarm system.
When the vehicle is locked, the alarm does not go off when the electrical connection with the trailer is cut if it has rear lights with light-emit- ting diodes.





Trailer loading
Technically permissible maximum trailer weight and vertical load on the coupling de- vice
The technically permissible maximum trailer weight is the weight that the vehicle can tow
›››  . The vertical load on the coupling is
exerted vertically from above on the ball of the towing bracket.
The information on the maximum trailer weight and vertical load on the coupling de- vice contained in the type plate of the towing bracket are experimental values only. The cor- rect figures for your specific model, which may be lower than these figures, are given in the vehicle documentation. The information in the vehicle documentation takes precedence at all times.
To promote safety while driving, CUPRA rec- ommends making the most of the maximum technically permitted vertical load on the cou-
pling device ››› page 294. An insufficient ver-
tical load has a negative influence on the be- haviour of both the vehicle and trailer.
The vertical load increases the weight on the rear axle, reducing the vehicle's carrying ca- pacity.


298




Gross combination weight of the towing ve- hicle and trailer
The gross combination weight is the actual weight of the loaded vehicle plus the actual weight of the loaded trailer.
In some countries trailers are classified into different categories. CUPRA recommends ob- taining information from a specialised work- shop regarding which type of trailer is most suitable for your vehicle.

Trailer loading
The weight of the towing vehicle and trailer must be balanced. In order to do this, the load must be as close as possible to the maximum technically permitted vertical load on the cou- pling point, and it must be evenly distributed between the back and front of the trailer:
? Distribute loads in the trailer so that heavy objects are as near to the axle as possible or above it.
? Secure the trailer load properly.

Tyre pressure
Set the tyre pressure of the trailer tyres in ac- cordance with the trailer manufacturer's rec- ommendations.
When towing a trailer, inflate the tyres of the towing vehicle to the maximum allowable pres-
sure ››› page 334.






Driving with a trailer
Adjusting the headlights
The front part of the vehicle may be raised when the trailer is connected and the light may dazzle the rest of the traffic.

Specific features of driving with a trailer
? If your trailer has an overrun brake, brake gently at first and then rapidly. This will prevent the jerking that can be caused by the locking of trailer wheels.
? Due to the gross combination weight of the towing vehicle and trailer, the braking distance increases.
? The trailer weight, as well as the gross combi- nation weight of the towing vehicle and trailer, change the centre of gravity and the proper- ties of the vehicle.
? If the towing vehicle is empty and the trailer is loaded, then the load distribution is incor- rect. Under these conditions, drive slowly and with extra caution.

Hill starts with a trailer
Depending on the slope of the hill and the combination weight of the towing vehicle and trailer, the vehicle might start rolling backwards slightly when you first start up.
For hill starts with a trailer hitched:
? Press and hold the brake pedal.
? Press the  button once to release the elec- tronic parking brake ››› page 205.
? Move the selector lever to the D/B position.
? Press and hold the button to hold the tow- ing vehicle and trailer set with the electronic parking brake.
? Release the brake pedal.


299




? Move off slowly.
? Do not release the button until the engine has sufficient power to start driving.



Stabilisation of the towing vehicle and trailer combination
The stabilisation of the vehicle and trailer com- bination is an additional function of the elec- tronic stability control (ESC).
If the system detects that the trailer is weav- ing, it intervenes to reduce the swaying of the trailer.

Vehicle and trailer combination stabilisation requirements
? The vehicle is factory-equipped with a tow- ing bracket or has been retro-fitted with a compatible towing bracket.
? The ESC and TCS are active. The control lamp  or is not lit up on the instrument cluster.
? The trailer is connected to the towing vehicle through the trailer power socket.
? The vehicle is travelling at over 60 km/h (ap- prox. 37 mph).
? The maximum vertical load technically per- missible is not being exceeded on the coupling device.
? The trailer has a rigid draw bar.
? If the trailer has brakes, it must be equipped with a mechanical overrun brake.

Installing a rear carrier system or a bicycle rack on the trailer hitch




Examples of rear carrier systems are bicycle racks or multi-purpose boxes that are installed on the trailer hitch.
Only use rear carrier systems that have been specified by the respective manufacturer for the vehicle model, model year and version of
the vehicle in question ›››  .
CUPRA recommends the use of genuine CU- PRA spare parts and accessories, which can be purchased from the brand's dealers. Install the rear carrier system according to the manufac- turer's installation instructions.
The load capacity results from the weight of the rear carrier system and the weight of the load carried on it.

The recommended maximum load capacity of the rear carrier system installed on the trailer hitch may be different from the maximum ver- tical load on the specific vehicle coupling.
However, it is not permitted to exceed the maximum permitted vertical load on the tow hitch (which depends on the model).
The load capacity is reduced due to the lever effect that occurs the further the carrier sys- tem is from the ball head.
Place heavy objects as close as possible to the trailer hitch ››› Fig. 177.

Maximum load capacity depending on the vehicle
To find out the recommended load capacity for your vehicle, check the maximum vertical
load on its coupling ››› page 366. Please refer
to the following table for the load capacity.
In accordance with the UN-R-55 guideline, CUPRA recommends not carrying more bicy- cles than recommended on the rear rack sys- tem.

CUPRA recommends that towing brackets be retrofitted at a specialised workshop. For ex- ample, it may very well be necessary to adjust the cooling system or mount thermal protec- tion plates. To do so, CUPRA recommends go- ing to a specialised CUPRA dealer or any SEAT dealership.
If a towing bracket is retrofitted, the distance specifications should always be kept in mind.
The distance between the centre of the ball head and the road ››› Fig. 179 C must never
be less than that indicated. This also applies when the vehicle is fully loaded, including the technically permissible maximum vertical load on the coupling device.

Changing the wiper blades








The windscreen wiper blades are supplied as standard with a layer of graphite. This layer is responsible for ensuring that the wipe is silent. If the graphite layer is damaged, the noise of the water as it is wiped across the windscreen will be louder.
Check the condition of the wiper blades reg- ularly. If the wipers scrape across the glass, they should be changed if they are damaged,
or cleaned if they are dirty ›››  .
If this does not produce the desired results, the setting angle of the windscreen wiper arms might be incorrect. They should be checked by a specialised workshop and corrected if neces- sary.
Damaged windscreen wiper blades should be replaced immediately. These are available from qualified workshops.

Raising and lowering windscreen wiper arms
? Place the windscreen wipers in the service position ››› page 305.
? Grip the wiper arms only by the blade's at- tachment point.

Cleaning the windscreen wiper blades
? Raise the wiper arms.
? Use a soft cloth to remove dust and dirt from the windscreen wiper blades.

Jump start
Introduction
Due to technical reasons, tow starting the vehi- cle is not allowed.
If the drive system cannot be switched on be- cause the 12 volt battery is discharged, the 12- volt battery of another vehicle can be used for this purpose.
Suitable jump leads are required for the jump start.
The cross section of jump leads for vehicles with electric drive systems must be a minimum of 25 mm2.




Jump start socket (ground termi- nal)



The jump start socket (ground terminal) is used for connecting the black jump lead
››› Fig. 185.
Only use this socket (ground terminal) when jump starting.

3. Connect the other end of the red jump lead to the positive terminal + in the vehi- cle providing assistance B .
4. Connect one end of the black jump lead C to a suitable ground terminal, to a solid piece of metal in the engine block, or to the engine block itself.
5. Connect one end of the black jump lead D to a suitable ground terminal in the ve- hicle with the flat 12 volt battery.
6. Position the leads in such a way that they cannot come into contact with any rotat- ing part in the front compartment.
10. 
Only disconnect the jump leads in the or- der 4 > 3 > 2 > 1 with the drive system switched on and the engine of the vehicle supplying the current running, or the elec- tric vehicle ignition switched on.
11. Close the battery cover if necessary.
If the drive system cannot be switched on, sus- pend the process and try again after approx. 1 minute. If the drive system still does not switch on, seek the assistance of qualified personnel.

Make sure that the clamps have sufficient metal contact when connecting them to the poles.

Jump lead terminal connections
The jump leads should only be connected in the order 1 > 2 > 3 > 4 ››› Fig. 186.
Never connect the black jump lead to the neg- ative pole - of the 12-volt battery. Connecting it to the negative pole may cause an incorrect assessment of the status of the battery in the vehicle's electronic system.

Towing the vehicle
Introduction
It takes practice to tow a vehicle, especially when using a tow cable. Both drivers should be well informed of the special features of towing. Inexperienced drivers should refrain from tow- ing.

During towing, make sure at all times that no inadmissible pulling forces or jolts are caused. On roads without a firm surface there is always the danger of overloading the attachment parts.
Observe the legal provisions regarding towing.

Towing
Towing means a vehicle pulling another vehicle that is not in a condition to drive.
The vehicle can be towed with a tow bar or cable.
? The speed limit is 50 km/h (30 mph).
? The maximum permitted distance is 50 km (30 miles).

Tow cable and tow bar
It is safer for the vehicle to be towed using a tow bar, avoiding damage to the vehicle. The tow cable should only be used if a tow bar is not available.
A tow rope should be slightly elastic to avoid damage to both vehicles. It is advisable to use a tow rope made of synthetic fibre or similarly elastic material.

Towing with a tow truck
The vehicle may only be transported on a tow truck if all four wheels are supported.

Deactivating roll-away protection
››› page 205
If necessary, to release the parking brake so that the vehicle can be pushed or towed:
? Keep the brake pedal pressed down and se- lect the N position on the gear selector. Next, confirm Deactivate roll-away protection in the Infotainment System.
? OR: open the vehicle settings in the infotain- ment system	> Settings > Brakes > Deacti- vate the "Roll-away protection" function.




309





	
Towing instructions
During towing, the change of direction can be signalled on the towed vehicle even when the hazard warning lights are on. To do so, at the same time, the turn signal lever must be oper- ated with ignition switched on. During this time the hazard warning lights remain disconnec- ted. When the turn signal lever is returned to the neutral position, the hazard warning lights will be automatically reactivated.

Cases where the vehicle must never be towed
Do not allow the vehicle to be towed for a long distance on its wheels in the following situa- tions:
? A red warning light lights up on the instru- ment cluster display and a message is dis- played:
Towing damages the electrical sys- tem. Manual!
? 
The power supply of the on-board 12-volt electrical system cannot be guaranteed.
? The 12-volt battery is discharged. The steer- ing remains locked and, if applicable, the park- ing brake cannot be released and the elec- tronic steering column lock cannot be released if they are engaged.
? The indicator on the instrument cluster dis- play is not working properly.
? It is not possible to set the gears to neutral (N).
? There is no guarantee that the wheels will turn smoothly or that the steering will work af- ter an accident.
If the vehicle cannot be towed on its wheels for any of the reasons mentioned above, request assistance from specialised personnel and, if necessary, have the vehicle transported with- out the wheels touching the ground. Inform the people involved in the towing process, es- pecially the organising centre and the carrier, that it is an electric vehicle.

Towing
Preliminary steps
? Secure the tow cable or tow bar using only the attachment points provided for this pur-
pose ›››  . Depending on the equipment,
these points may be a towing device or a tow- ing eye.


310




? Make sure the tow cable is not twisted. Oth- erwise the towing eye could unscrew during towing.
? Switch on the ignition and the hazard warn- ing lights of both vehicles. If necessary, take into account other different provisions that may exist in this regard.
? Take into account the instructions on towing provided in the instruction manual of the other vehicle.

Towing vehicle (lead)
The vehicle is not suitable for towing other ve- hicles.

Towed vehicle (following)
? Make sure the ignition is switched on so that the steering wheel does not lock and so that, if necessary, you can use the turn signals and the windscreen wiper.
? The brake servo and the power steering only works with the drive system connected. Other- wise, you will have to depress the brake pedal considerably harder and more force will be needed to turn the steering wheel.
? Make sure the tow cable is always taut.
? Select the N gear position.
If the conditions for towing are not met, the vehicle can be towed or pushed on all
four wheels in emergency situations. However,

towing is only permitted at walking speed and a maximum of 100 m to the tow truck
››› .

Front towline anchorage
















The housing of the removable towline anchor- age is on the right side of the front bumper
underneath a cover ››› Fig. 187.
The towing eye should always be kept in the vehicle.


311




Bear in mind the instructions for towing
››› page 310.
Fitting the towline anchorage
? Remove the towing eye from the vehicle tool kit in the luggage compartment ››› page 305.
? Remove the cover by pressing down on its base and leave it hanging from the vehicle
››› Fig. 187.
? Screw the towing eye in the housing by turning it to the maximum anticlockwise
››› Fig. 188 , ›››  . Use a suitable object

Fuses
Introduction
In general, a fuse can be assigned to various electrical components. Likewise, an electrical component can be protected by several fuses.
Only replace fuses when the cause of the problem has been solved. If a newly inserted fuse blows after a short time, you must have the electrical system checked by a specialised workshop as soon as possible.

Fuses for the emergency services (high volt- age system)
In the fuse box inside the vehicle ››› page 314 there is a high voltage system fuse marked with a little yellow flag that allows the emer- gency services to cut off the vehicle's voltage as quickly as possible. Never replace this fuse

yourself or place it where other fuses are lo- cated. If this fuse fails, have it replaced by a qualified specialist workshop.

Rescue cut-off point (high voltage system)
Under the right rear tail light there is a loop also identified with a yellow flag which, if nec- essary, can be cut by the emergency services. Warning! To access this loop, remove the tail light's lower rubber waterproof seal, or remove the tail light or, in extreme cases, break it.

Checking and refilling levels
Front compartment
Working in the front compartment
The vehicle's front compartment is a hazard- ous area. You should only perform works in the engine compartment if you have good knowl- edge of the necessary operations and the gen- eral safety measures, and if you have adequate tools, means and operating fluids. Works per- formed inadequately could lead to serious in-
juries ›››  . In this case, get a specialised
workshop to perform all the works. CUPRA rec- ommends going to a specialised CUPRA dealer or any SEAT dealership for this purpose.
Before performing any work in the engine compartment, always park the vehicle on level and firm ground, taking all necessary safety precautions.

Fluids and consumables
Introduction
All fluids and consumables, such as engine coolant or vehicle batteries, are subject to continuous development. For this reason, whenever a fluid or consumable needs to be replaced, please contact a specialist workshop.
CUPRA dealers always promptly receive infor- mation about any modifications.


Cooling system
Introduction
Only carry out work on the engine cooling sys- tem yourself if you are familiar with the neces- sary operations and the generally applicable safety measures, and if you have the appro- priate tools, equipment and operating fluids. Works performed inadequately could lead to serious injuries . In this case, get a specialised workshop to perform all the works. CUPRA rec- ommends going to a specialised CUPRA dealer or any SEAT dealership for this purpose.
In the "Troubleshooting" section at the end of this chapter can be found information on the warning and control lamps that may light up
››› page 325.







Coolant specifications
The factory fitted engine cooling system is fil- led with a mixture of specially treated water and at least 40% coolant additive G12evo (TL- VW 774 L).


322




Get information from a specialist workshop about which coolant is suitable for your vehi- cle. CUPRA recommends going to a specialised CUPRA dealer or any SEAT dealership for this purpose.
To protect the engine cooling system, the ad- ditive percentage should always be at least 40%. If more antifreeze protection is required for climatic reasons, the additive proportion can be increased. However, it should only be increased up to a maximum of 55%, otherwise the antifreeze protection would be reduced and the cooling effect would be impaired.
The G12evo (TL-VW 774 L) can be recognised by its lilac colouring. This mixture of water and additive not only provides antifreeze pro- tection down to -25°C (-13°F), but also pro-
tects the light alloy parts of the cooling system against corrosion, prevents limescale build-up and considerably raises the boiling point of the coolant.
When topping up the coolant, a mixture of distilled water and at least 40% of the appro- priate coolant additive should be used for opti-
mum corrosion protection ››› page 323.




Check and refill the coolant















323













Preliminary steps
? Park the vehicle on a firm, flat surface.
? Wait for the electric drive system to cool down ››› .
? Open the front bonnet ›››	in Working in the front compartment on page 318.
? The motor coolant expansion tank can be recognised by the symbol on the cap
››› Fig. 198
Check the level
When the vehicle is delivered (new vehicles), the coolant may be above the marked area. This is normal. It is not necessary to suck the coolant out.
? 
When the electric drive system is cold, check the coolant level using the side marking on the
expansion tank ››› Fig. 197. The coolant level
should be between the marks.
? If the level is below the minimum level mark ( ) on the tank, top up with coolant. When the engine is warm, the coolant level may be slightly above the upper mark.

Topping up the fluid
When the motor coolant level is too low, the coolant warning light comes on. In this case, immediately seek assistance from specialist personnel.
If the coolant level is too low and there is no workshop nearby, note the following:
? Always protect your face, hands and arms from hot coolant or steam by placing a suita- ble cloth over the cap of the motor coolant expansion tank.
? Carefully unscrew the cap ›››  .
? Only top up with fresh coolant according to CUPRA specifications ››› page 322.
? Only top up with coolant if there is still some coolant left in the expansion tank; otherwise the drive system could be damaged! If you do not see any coolant in the expansion tank, do not continue driving and seek specialist assis- tance.
? 
If there is still some coolant left in the ex- pansion tank, top up with coolant up to the tank's upper mark and check the level the next day. If the level drops again, go to a workshop and request a check of the cooling system.
? The coolant level must be between the marks on the expansion tank ››› Fig. 197. Never exceed the top edge of the marked area ››› .
? Screw the cap on tightly.
? If engine coolant with the recommended specifications is not available in an emergency, do not use any other coolant additive! In this
case, top up with distilled water ››› only.
Next, ensure that the recommended additive is topped up as soon as possible in the correct
proportion ››› page 322.




324



If the warning lamp does not go out even though the motor coolant level is correct, do not continue to drive or leave the engine run- ning.
? Seek specialist assistance.









Troubleshooting

Motor coolant fluid
The warning lamp flashes red.
The motor coolant temperature is too high or the motor coolant level is too low.
? Stop driving! Stop the vehicle at the first opportunity and in a safe place.
? Switch off the drive system.
? Wait for the electric drive system to cool down.
? Check the coolant level in the coolant ex- pansion tank ››› page 323.
    
along with	: Failure in the cooling system of the high-voltage system
The warning lamps flash red. Stop the vehicle immediately!
? Switch off the drive system.
? Seek specialist assistance.

Brake fluid
Check and refill the brake fluid




325




Checking the brake fluid level
The brake fluid level must be between the and	markings.
However, if the brake fluid level goes down no- ticeably in a short time, or drops below the
   mark, there may be a leak in the brake sys- tem. Seek specialist assistance. A warning light on the instrument cluster display monitors the brake fluid level.

Brake fluid level
The control lamp lights up red. Brake fluid level is too low.
? Stop driving!
? Check the brake fluid level.
? If the brake fluid level is too low, seek special- ist assistance.

Changing brake fluid
We recommend that you have the brake fluid changed by a Technical Service.




Windscreen washer reser- voir
Checking the level of the wind- screen washer reservoir and refill- ing it



Check the water level in the windscreen washer reservoir regularly and top up as re- quired.
The windscreen washer tank contains liquid detergent for the windscreen and washing the rear camera.
326




There is a sieve in the filler neck of the washer fluid tank. When filling the tank, this sieve re- tains large dirt particles so that they do not reach the nozzles. Do not remove the sieve except for cleaning. If the sieve is damaged or not fitted, these dirt particles could enter the system during filling and clog the windscreen washer nozzles.
? Open the front bonnet ›››  on page 318.
? The windscreen washer reservoir is marked with the symbol on the cap.
? Check if there is enough fluid in the tank.
Plain water is not enough to clean the wind- screen and headlights. We recommend that you always add a product to the windscreen washer fluid.

The capacity of the windscreen washer reser- voir is approximately 3 litres.















12-volt battery
Introduction
The 12 volt battery is located in the front compartment, under the bonnet. It is part of the electrical system and, in the event of a high-voltage system power supply failure it en- sures that power is supplied to vehicle systems

of relevance to safety. The 12 volt battery is checked and, if necessary, replaced as part of maintenance work.
All work on batteries requires specialist knowl- edge. Please refer to a specialised CUPRA Service, SEAT Official Service or a workshop specialising in batteries: risk of burns or ex- ploding battery!
The battery must not be opened! Never try to change the fluid level of the battery. Otherwise explosive gas is released from the battery that could cause an explosion.

Battery warning indications
Wear protective goggles.

Battery acid is extremely corrosive. Wear protective gloves and eye protection.
 Rinse any splashes of electrolyte with plenty of water.
Fires, sparks, open flames and smoking are prohibited.
The battery should only be charged in a well-ventilated zone. Risk of explosion!
Keep children away from acid and the bat- tery.
Always follow the instruction manual.


327











Check the electrolyte level
The 12-volt battery is located in the front com- partment, under the bonnet.
The electrolyte level of the 12-volt battery can- not be checked, as the battery sight glass is covered by the vehicle's main fuse box.

Always have the battery electrolyte level checked by a qualified specialist workshop.

Charging, replacing, disconnecting and connecting the 12-volt battery
If you suspect that the 12-volt battery is dam- aged or defective, have it checked by a quali- fied specialist workshop.

Charging the 12-volt battery
Contact a specialist workshop for charging the 12-volt battery, as the battery model fitted in the vehicle in the factory uses a technology
that requires limited voltage charging ›››  .
CUPRA recommends going to a specialised CUPRA dealer or any SEAT dealership for this purpose.

Replacing the 12-volt battery
The 12-volt vehicle battery has been designed to suit its location and has special safety fea- tures. If a 12-volt battery needs to be replaced, the replacement battery must be installed by
a qualified technician. CUPRA recommends that you visit a CUPRA dealer. Component in- formation regarding size, maintenance, power and safety characteristics to be met can be ob- tained from a qualified technician, who should have the necessary documentation and tech- nical equipment. CUPRA recommends visiting a specialised CUPRA dealer or any SEAT deal- ership.


328




The degassing hole of the 12-volt battery must always be on side of the negative pole. The degassing hole on the side of the positive pole must always be sealed.
Only use maintenance-free 12-volt batteries that comply with the TL 825 06 and VW 7 50 73 standards. These standards must be dated Oc- tober 2014 or later.
The 12-volt battery must always be replaced by a qualified technician, as the vehicle's elec- tronic system must also be adjusted as part of the replacement. In addition, the battery pa-
rameters relating to operational safety can only be determined with the original battery. Only
a qualified technician has both access to the right technology to make the adjustment and the correct replacement batteries.



Disconnecting the 12-volt battery
If the 12-volt battery is to be disconnected from the vehicle's electrical system, please note the following:
? 
Switch off all electrical consumers.
? Before disconnecting the battery, unlock the vehicle, otherwise the alarm will be triggered.
? First disconnect the negative cable and then the positive cable ››› .

Connecting the 12-volt battery
? Switch off all electrical consumers before re- connecting the 12-volt battery.
? First reconnect the positive cable and then the negative one ››› .
After connecting the 12-volt battery and switching on the ignition, several control lamps may light up. These lamps go out after a short distance at a speed of approx. 15 to 20 km/h (10 to 12 mph). If the warning lights do not go out, visit a specialist workshop and have the vehicle checked.
If the 12-volt battery has been disconnected for a long period of time, it is likely that
the next service will not be correctly indi- cated or calculated ››› page 15 . In this case it will be necessary to take into account
the maximum permitted maintenance intervals
››› page 344.
Vehicles with a "Keyless Access" system
››› page 94: If the ignition cannot be switched
on after connecting the 12-volt battery, lock and unlock the vehicle from the outside. Then try to switch on the ignition again. If the ignition does not work, seek professional assistance.

Automatic disconnection of consumers
In the event of excessive demand on the
12-volt battery, the on-board network smart management system automatically takes cer- tain measures to prevent the battery from dis- charging:
? If necessary, the power of the most powerful consumers is limited or, in an emergency, they are switched off completely.

Factors causing the 12-volt battery to dis- charge
? Use of electric consumers while the drive system is disconnected.



329












Troubleshooting

Error: 12 V battery. Restart impossible. Go to the workshop.
There is a fault in the connection between the on-board network and the 12-volt battery.
If the drive system is switched off in this situa- tion, it cannot be switched on again. If neces-
sary, use the jump leads ››› page 307 or seek
assistance from qualified personnel.

Wheels and tyres
Important information about wheels and tyres
General notes
? Your vehicle is fitted with "self-sealing"tyres. This system seals punctures smaller than 5 mm so that the tyre does not have to be replaced.
If the puncture ››› page 342 is not sealed,
you should call for help or wait for roadside assistance services.
? When driving with new tyres, be especially careful during the first 600 km (300 miles).
? If you have to drive over a kerb or similar ob- stacle, drive very slowly and as near as possible at a right angle to the obstacle.
? Check from time to time if the tyres are damaged (punctures, cuts, cracks or dents). Remove any foreign objects embedded in the treads.
? Damaged wheels and tyres must be replaced immediately.
? Keep grease, oil and fuel off the tyres.
? Replace any missing valve caps as soon as possible.

Wheels and tyres

? Mark the wheels before taking them off so that they rotate in the same direction when put back.
? When removed, the wheels or tyres should be stored in a cool, dry and preferably dark place.

Low profile tyres
Low profile tyres have a wider tread, a larger wheel diameter and a lower sidewall height. This results in more agile driving behaviour.
Low profile tyres may deteriorate more quickly than standard tyres, for instance due to
heavy impacts, potholes, manhole covers and kerbs. Correct tyre pressure is very important
››› page 334.
To avoid damage to tyres and wheels, drive with special care when driving on roads in poor condition.
Visually check your wheels every 3000 km.
If the tyres or rims have received a heavy im- pact or have been damaged, have a special- ised workshop check whether or not it is nec- essary to change the tyre.
Low profile tyres may deteriorate more quickly than standard tyres.

Concealed damage
Damage to tyres and rims is often not readily visible. If you notice unusual vibration or the car pulling to one side, this may indicate that one of the tyres is damaged. Reduce speed im-



mediately if there is any reason to suspect that damage may have occurred. Inspect the tyres for damage. If no external damage is visible, drive slowly and carefully to the nearest speci- alised workshop and have the car inspected.

Foreign objects inserted in the tyre
? Do not remove foreign bodies if they have penetrated through the tyre wall!
? Use a specialised workshop for repair or re- placement. CUPRA recommends going to a specialised CUPRA dealer or any SEAT dealer- ship for this purpose.
The sealant inside the tyre tread wraps around the foreign body and provisionally seals the tyre.

Tyres with directional tread pattern
An arrow on the tyre sidewall indicates the rotation direction on directional tyres. Always note the rotation direction indicated when mounting the wheel. This makes sure that op- timal use is made of tyre properties in terms of aquaplaning, grip, excessive noise and wear.

Retrofitting of accessories
If you wish to change or fit wheels, rims or wheel trims, we recommend that you consult with a specialised CUPRA Service or SEAT Offi- cial Service centre for advice regarding current technical recommendations.

New wheels and tyres
It is best to have all wheels and tyres serviced by a specialised workshop. There they have the required knowledge, the special tools and the corresponding spare parts.
? The vehicle is factory fitted with original CU- PRA tyres with optimised rolling resistance. The original CUPRA tyres are marked with the sym- bol . Only with these tyres can the speci-
fied energy consumption and range be ach- ieved. When buying new tyres, always make sure they have optimised rolling resistance
››› page 149.
? Even winter tyres lose their grip on ice. If you have installed new tyres, drive the first 600 km carefully and at a moderate speed.
? All four wheels must be fitted with tyres
of the same type, size (rolling circumference) and, if possible, tread pattern.
? When changing tyres, do not change just one; change at least two on the same axle.
? If you want to equip your vehicle with a com- bination of tyres and rims that are different to those fitted in the factory, inform your special-
ised workshop before purchasing them ›››
The sizes of the rims and tyres approved for your vehicle are listed in the vehicle documen- tation (e.g. EC Certificate of Conformity or
COC document1)). The vehicle documentation varies depending on the country of residence.

If the type of spare wheel is different form the normal wheels - e.g. in the case of win- ter tyres or particularly wide tyres - the spare wheel should only be used temporarily in the
event of a puncture, and the vehicle should be driven with care. Refit the normal road wheel as soon as possible.
In vehicles with four-wheel drive, the 4 wheels must be fitted with tyres of the same brand, type and tread so that the traction system is not damaged by a difference in the number of turns of the wheels. Therefore, in the event of a puncture, only a spare wheel with the same perimeter as normal tyres should be used.

Manufacturing date
The manufacturing date is also indicated on the tyre sidewall (or on the inside face of the wheel):
DOT ... 2220 ...
this means, for example, that the tyre was manufactured in the 22nd week of 2020.


1) COC = certificate of conformity.




333


Tyre life









Correct inflation pressures and sensible driving habits will increase the useful life of your tyres.
? Check tyre pressure at least once a month, and also prior to any long trip.
? The tyre pressure should only be checked when the tyres are cold. Do not reduce the pressure of warm tyres.
? Adjust tyre pressure to the load being carried by the vehicle ››› Fig. 201.
? In vehicles with a tyre pressure indicator, save the modified tyre pressure ››› page 342.


334




? Avoid fast cornering and hard acceleration.
? Inspect the tyres for irregular wear from time to time.

Tyre pressure
The tyre pressure values are shown on the sticker located on the rear frame of the front
left door ››› Fig. 201.
Insufficient or excessive pressure greatly re- duces the useful life of the tyres and adversely affects vehicle performance and ride. Correct inflation pressures are very important, espe- cially at high speeds.
The tyre pressure must be adjusted according to the load the vehicle is carrying. If the vehicle is going to be fully loaded, increase the tyre pressure to the maximum load value shown on
the sticker ››› Fig. 201.
Do not forget the spare wheel when checking the tyre pressures: Keep this spare wheel infla- ted to the highest pressure required for the road wheels.
In the case of a minimised temporary spare wheel (125/70 R16 or 125/70 R18) inflate to a pressure of 4.2 bar as indicated on the tyre
pressure label ››› Fig. 201.
Driving style
Fast cornering, heavy acceleration and hard braking (squealing tyres) all increase tyre wear.

Wheel balance
The wheels on new vehicles are balanced. However, certain circumstances may lead to imbalance (run-out), which is detected as vi- brations in the steering wheel.
Unbalanced wheels should be rebalanced, as they otherwise cause excessive wear on steer- ing, suspension and tyres. A wheel must also be rebalanced when a new tyre is fitted or if a tyre is repaired.

Incorrect wheel alignment
Incorrect running gear alignment causes ex- cessive tyre wear, impairing the safety of the vehicle. If you notice excessive tyre wear, you should check wheel alignment at a specialised CUPRA Service or SEAT Official Service.





Tread wear indicators


335













Wear indicators around 1.6 mm high can be found on the base of the original tyre treads, ordered at regular intervals and running across
the tread ››› Fig. 202. The letters "TWI" or
triangles on the sidewall of the tyre mark the position of the wear indicators.
The minimum permitted profile depth 1) have been reached when the tyres have worn down to the wear indicators. Replace the tyres with
new ones ›››  .
With a sporty driving style, check the tread depth every 5,000 / 10,000 km (3,000 / 6,000 mi). When checking the tread depth, check the wear indicators in all the tyre grooves.

Changing wheels around
In order to wear the wheels in a uniform manner, it is recommended to interchange them regularly according to the diagram
››› Fig. 203. The useful life of all the tyres will
then be about the same time.

Wheel nuts
The wheel nuts and rims have been designed to be part of an assembly. When installing different wheels (for instance alloy wheels or wheels with winter tyres) it is important to use the correct wheel nuts with the right length and correctly shaped bolt heads. This ensures that wheels are fitted securely and that the brake system functions correctly.
The wheel nuts must be clean and turn easily.
A special adapter is required to turn the anti- theft wheel nuts ››› page 339.

Two-piece wheel nuts
Two-piece wheel nuts must be used for this vehicle. In this type of bolt, the spherical collar is not firmly attached to the head.




1) Follow the regulations of the country you are driving in.
336







Winter tyres
? Winter tyres must be fitted on all four
wheels.
? Only use winter tyres that are approved for your vehicle.
? Please note that the maximum permissible speed for winter tyres may be lower than for summer tyres.
? Also note that winter tyres are no longer ef- fective when the tread is worn down.
? After fitting the wheels you must always check the tyre pressures. When doing so, take into account the correct tyre pressures listed on the rear of the front left door frame
››› page 334.
In winter road conditions winter tyres will con- siderably improve vehicle handling. The design of summer tyres (width, rubber compound, tread pattern) gives less grip on ice and snow. This applies particularly to vehicles equipped with wide section tyres or with high speed tyres (code letters H, V or Y on the sidewall).

Only use winter tyres of the correct type ap- proved for your vehicle. The sizes of these tyres are specified in the vehicle's documents
(e.g. EC Certificate of Conformity or COC1)). The vehicle documentation varies depending on the country of residence.
Winter tyres lose a great deal of their proper- ties when the tread is worn down to a depth of 4 mm.
The performance of winter tyres is also se- verely impaired by ageing, even if the tread is still much deeper than 4 mm.
A code letter indicating the speed limit is stam- ped on all winter tyres ››› page 332.
In the infotainment system's Vehicle settings menu, a speed warning can be set in the Tyres menu.
Vehicles capable of exceeding these speeds must have an appropriate sticker attached so that it is visible to the driver. Suitable stickers are available at specialised CUPRA Services, SEAT Official Service centres and specialised workshops. Please note the regulations to this effect in your country.
"All-weather" tyres can also be used instead of winter tyres.

Using winter tyres with a V-rating
Please note that the generally applicable 240 km/h (149 mph) speed for winter tyres
with the letter V is subject to technical restric- tions; the maximum permissible speed for your vehicle may be significantly lower. The maximum speed limit for these tyres depends directly on the maximum axle weights for your car and on the listed weight rating of the tyres being used.
It is best to contact a specialised CUPRA Serv- ice or SEAT Official Service to check the max- imum speed which is permissible for the V- rated tyres fitted on your car on the basis of this information.






1) COC = certificate of conformity.



337




Snow chains
Snow chains may only be fitted to the rear wheels.
? Check that they are correctly seated after driving for a few yards; correct the position
if necessary, in accordance with the manufac- turer's fitting instructions.
? Keep your speed below 50 km/h (30 mph).

Snow chains will improve braking ability as well as traction in winter conditions.
For technical reasons, the use of snow chains is only permitted on the following rim and tyre combinations:

TyresWheel rimChains255/45 R209J x 20 ET 42Max link.
13.5 mm.Other dimensions do not allow chains
Remove any central wheel trims before fitting snow chains.

Changing a wheel
Introduction
Only change a wheel yourself if you are famil- iar with the necessary operations and safety measures, if you have the necessary tools and if the vehicle is parked safely.

Preliminary actions
? Stop the vehicle on a level surface and in a safe place, as far away from road traffic as pos- sible.
? Apply the electronic parking brake.
? Switch off the drive system and ignition.
? Switch on the hazard warning lights.
? If towing a trailer, unhitch the trailer from your vehicle.
? Lay out the on-board tools ››› page 305 and the wheel to be changed.
? Follow the legal provisions of each country (reflective vest, warning triangles, light beacon, etc.).
? Get all occupants out of the vehicle and keep them out of the danger zone (e.g. behind the guard rail).





338



The anti-theft wheel locking bolt has a spe- cial cap. This only fits on anti-theft locking bolts and is not for use with standard wheel nuts.

Anti-theft wheel nuts



Wheel nut caps


Loosening wheel nuts











Removal
? Fit the plastic clip (vehicle tools ››› Fig. 181) over the cap until it clicks into place
››› Fig. 204.
? Remove the cap with the plastic clip.
The caps protect the wheel nuts and should be remounted after changing the tyre.

Loosening the anti-theft wheel nut
? Remove the wheel trim or hub cap.
? Insert the special adapter ››› Fig. 205 1
(vehicle tools ››› page 305) onto the anti-
theft wheel nut and push it on as far as it will go.
? Insert the wheel wrench (not supplied by the factory) onto the adapter as far as it will go.
? Remove the wheel nut ››› page 339.



To loosen the wheel nuts, use a wheel wrench the exact size of the bolt head.
Loosen the wheel nuts only about one turn before raising the vehicle with the jack.
If the wheel nut is very tight, carefully push on the end of the wheel wrench with your foot. Hold on to the vehicle for support and take care not to slip during this operation.


339




Loosening wheel nuts
? Fit the box spanner into the bolt as far as it will go ››› Fig. 206.
? Hold the wrench at the end and rotate the bolt approximately one turn anticlock-
wise ›››  .
Important information about wheel nuts
Factory-fitted rims and wheel nuts are specially matched during construction. Therefore, if dif- ferent rims are fitted, the correct wheel nuts with the right length and heads must be used. This ensures that wheels are fitted securely and that the brake system functions correctly.
In certain circumstances, you should not even use wheel nuts from vehicles of the same model.














Raise the vehicle









? Rest the jack (not supplied from the factory) on firm ground. If necessary use a large, strong board or similar support. If the surface is slip- pery (for example tiles) place the jack on a rub- ber mat or similar to prevent it from slipping.
? Look on the crossbar for the mark of the jack support point (sunken area) closest to the
wheel to be changed ››› Fig. 207.
? Turn the jack crank handle, located below the crossbar support point, to raise it until the
tab 1 ››› Fig. 208 is below the housing that is
provided.
? Align the jack so that the tab 1 "grips" onto the housing provided on the cross mem- ber and the mobile base 2 is resting on the ground. The base plate 2 should fall vertically with respect to the support point 1 .
? Continue turning the jack until the wheel is slightly lifted off the ground.


340








 Removing and installing a wheel
Change the wheel after loosening the wheel bolts and raising the vehicle with the jack (not supplied by the factory).
When removing/fitting the wheel, the rim may hit and damage the brake disc. Therefore, please take care and get a second person to assist you.

Taking off the wheel
? Unscrew the bolts with the wheel wrench and place them on a clean surface.
? Remove the wheel.

Putting on the spare wheel
Check the direction of rotation of the tyre
››› page 341.
? Place the spare wheel or temporary spare wheel into position.
? Screw in the wheel bolts and tighten them a little with the wheel wrench.
? Use the appropriate adapter to tighten the anti-theft wheel bolts.
? Carefully lower the vehicle using the jack.
? 
Use the wheel spanner to tighten all of the wheel nuts clockwise. Tighten the bolts in di- agonal pairs (not in a circle).
? Put the caps, trim or full hubcap back on.

Tightening torque of the wheel nuts
The prescribed tightening torque for wheel bolts for steel and alloy wheels is 120 Nm.
After changing a wheel, have the tightening torque checked immediately with a torque wrench that is working perfectly.

The wheel bolts should be clean and turn easily. Before fitting the spare wheel, inspect the wheel condition and hub mounting surfa- ces. These surfaces must be clean before fit- ting the wheel.
Before checking tightening torque, have any rusty wheel bolts that are difficult to screw re- placed and clean the wheel hub threads.
Never apply grease or oil to wheel bolts or to the wheel hub threads. Even if the bolts have been tightened to the prescribed torque, they could come loose while driving.

Tyres with directional tread pattern
Tyres with directional tread pattern have been designed to operate best when rotating in only one direction. An arrow on the tyre sidewall indicates the rotation direction on tyres with directional tread. Always observe the indicated


341




rotation direction in order to guarantee opti- mum grip and help avoid aquaplaning, exces- sive noise and wear.
If the tyre is mounted in the opposite rotation direction, drive with extreme caution, as the tyre is no longer being used correctly. This is of particular importance when the road surface is wet. Change the tyre as soon as possible or remount it with the correct rotation direction.

Works after changing a wheel
? Replace the hub caps or wheel nut caps (de- pending on equipment).
? Return all tools to their proper storage loca- tion.
? There is no space in your vehicle for the wheel to be replaced; if necessary,
store it safely in the luggage compartment
››› page 288.
? Check the tyre pressure of the newly moun- ted tyre as soon as possible.
? In vehicles fitted with a tyre pressure indi- cator, adjust the pressure and store it in the
memory ››› page 342.
? Have the tightening torque of the wheel nuts checked as soon as possible with a torque
wrench ››› page 341. Meanwhile, drive care-
fully.
? Have the flat tyre replaced as quickly as pos- sible.

Tyre pressure monitor sys- tem
Tyre pressure monitor indicator








The tyre pressure monitoring system compares the individual speeds of each wheel and thus the dynamic radius with the help of the ABS sensors.
If the rolling circumference of one or more wheels has changed, the tyre pressure moni- toring indicator will indicate this on the instru- ment panel through a warning lamp and a
warning to the driver ››› Fig. 209. If only one
tyre is affected, its position on the vehicle will be indicated.
Loss of pressure: Check left tyre pressure!

Change in wheel diameter
The wheel diameter changes when:
? Tyre pressure is changed manually.
? The tyre pressure is insufficient.
? The tyre's structure is damaged.
? The vehicle is not level due to a load.
? The wheels on an axle are subject to a heav- ier load (e.g. with a heavy load).
? The vehicle is fitted with snow chains.
? The temporary spare wheel has been fitted.
? One wheel has been changed on an axle.
There may be a delay in the reaction of the tyre pressure monitoring indicator  or it may not indicate anything under certain circumstances (e.g. sporty driving, snow-covered or unpaved roads, or when driving with snow chains).

Calibrate the tyre pressure monitoring indi- cator
After changing the tyre pressure or replac- ing one or more wheels, the tyre pressure monitoring indicator must be recalibrated. This should also be done, for example, when switching the front and rear tyres.
It should be calibrated with the vehicle stop- ped and its tyres cold. If calibrated while the tyres are hot, the pressure check and calibra- tion procedure should be repeated when cold before the next trip.


342




? Switch the ignition on.
? Save the new inflation pressure in the info- tainment system: function button	>	Ve-
hicle > Exterior > Tyres ››› page 35.
? OR:	>	Vehicle > Status > Tyres.
After storing the new inflation pressure, a con- firmation message will be displayed, the warn- ing light in the instrument cluster will flash briefly and a driver alert tone will be played.
The tyre pressure loss indicator uses the ABS sensors to compare the turns of each wheel and, therefore, their tread circumferences, among other aspects. The set values are col- lected and monitored after a long journey at different speeds.
For example, if the wheels are under very heavy loads, the tyre pressure must be in- creased to the total recommended tyre pres-
sure before calibration ››› Fig. 209.




Troubleshooting

Low tyre pressure
The control lamp switches on yellow.
The inflation pressure of one or more wheels is much lower than the value set by the driver, or the tyre has structural damage. In addition,
a audible warning sounds and a text message is displayed on the instrument panel screen.
? Stop the vehicle! Stop the vehicle as soon as possible in a safe place.
? Check all tyres and pressures.
? Replace any damaged tyres.

Fault in the tyre pressure loss indicator
The control lamp flashes for approximately 1 minute and then lights up permanently in yel- low.
? If the tyre is inflated correctly, switch the ig- nition off and on again.
? Re-calibrate the tyre pressure monitoring system ››› page 342
? If the fault continues, go to a specialised workshop.

Vehicle upkeep and cleaning
Basic observations
Regular and careful care helps to maintain the value of your vehicle. In addition, it may be- come a prerequisite for a warranty claim in the event of corrosion damage and deficiencies in the paint coat of the bodywork.
Specialised workshops have the necessary care products. Please follow the application in- structions on the packaging.





Washing the vehicle
The longer you take to clean off deposits, e.g. remains of insects, bird excrements, tree resin or road salt adhered to your vehicle, the more damage it can cause to the surface. High tem- peratures, for instance strong sunlight, further intensify the damage.
Before washing the car, soften the dirt using plenty of water.
To remove encrusted dirt such as insects, bird droppings or tree resin, use a lot of water and a microfibre cloth.
Have the underside of the vehicle washed after the end of the road salts in winter.


346




High pressure cleaning equipment
When washing the vehicle with a high-pressure cleaner, always follow the operating instruc- tions for the equipment. This applies particu- larly to the operating pressure and the distance between the water jet and the vehicle.
Do not aim the jet directly towards the side windows, doors, sunroof or covers; the same applies for the tyres, rubber hoses, damping material, radar sensors or camera lenses. Keep a distance of at least 40 cm.
Do not remove snow and ice with a high-pres- sure cleaner.
Do not use a nozzle that sprays the water out in a direct stream or one that has a rotating jet for forcing off dirt.
The water temperature must not exceed 60°C.

Automatic car washes
Spray the vehicle before starting the car wash.
Make sure that the windows are closed and the windscreen wipers are deactivated. Bear in mind the instructions of the car wash tunnel operator, especially if your vehicle has detach- able parts.
Use car washes without brushes if possible.

Washing by hand
Clean your vehicle from top to bottom with a soft sponge or with a brush. Only use cleaning products that do not contain solvents.

High-voltage system instructions
Before washing the vehicle, end the charging process and close the charging socket com- pletely.
Please also note the safety warning regarding high-pressure cleaning equipment ››› on page 346.

Polishing
Polishing is only necessary when the vehicle's paintwork has lost its gloss and cannot be re- stored with care products.
Do not polish matt painted surfaces! If the paintwork is polished, the surface will be irrep- arably damaged.
Washing vehicles with matte paintwork To wash the vehicle, it is best to use a spe-
cial cleaner for matte paintwork. For further information, please contact an official service centre.
Apply the product by spraying it onto the body- work. Work in one zone at a time and leave
the product to act for at least 2 minutes. Wipe it with a microfibre cloth and avoid placing ex- cessive pressure on the treated area until the dirt is removed. Once clean, repeat the appli- cation of the product area by area and spread it until a uniform finish is achieved.
If the vehicle is affected by mosquitoes or larger amounts of dirt, spray the product on the entire surface, leave it to act for 2 minutes

and apply pressurised water until it is com- pletely clean. Once dry, apply the product one zone at a time and spread it with microfibre, avoiding excessive pressure, to achieve a uni- form finish.
In both cases, the final application cares for the vehicle in an optimal manner and provides a protective layer against dirt and water.

Accessories, spare parts and repair work
Introduction
Always ask your dealer or specialist retailer for advice before purchasing accessories and re- placement parts.
Your vehicle is designed to offer a high stand- ard of active and passive safety. For this rea- son, we recommend that you ask a specialised CUPRA Service or SEAT Official Service for ad- vice before fitting accessories or replacement

parts. Your Official Service has the latest in- formation from the manufacturer and can rec- ommend accessories and replacement parts which are suitable for your requirements. They can also answer any questions you might have regarding official regulations.
We recommend only using CUPRA accesso- ries and Genuine CUPRA parts(r). Specialised CUPRA Services or SEAT Official Services have the necessary experience and facilities to en- sure that the parts are installed correctly and professionally.
Although CUPRA continuously monitors the market, it cannot judge whether products not authorised by CUPRA meet the vehicle's reli- ability, safety and suitability requirements. CU- PRA therefore accepts no liability for these products, even if, in certain cases, they are au- thorised by an officially recognised technical inspection institute or official body.
Any retrofitted equipment which has a di- rect effect on the vehicle and/or the way it is driven, such as a cruise control system or
electronically-controlled suspension, must be approved for use in your vehicle and bear the e mark (the European Union's authorisa- tion symbol).
If any additional electrical devices are fitted which do not serve to control the vehicle itself (for instance a refrigerator box, laptop or venti- lator fan, etc.), they must bear the  marking (manufacturer conformity declaration in the European Union).


351







Technical modifications
Unauthorised modifications to the electronic components, software, wiring or data transfer in the vehicle may cause malfunctioning.
We request your understanding that your spe- cialised CUPRA dealer or SEAT dealership can- not be held liable for any damage caused by modifications and/or work performed incor- rectly in the vehicle.
We therefore recommend that all work should be performed by a specialised CUPRA Service or a SEAT Official Service using genuine CU- PRA parts(r).



Radio telephones and office equip- ment
Radio transmitters (fixed installation)
Any retrofit installations of radio transmitters in the vehicle require prior approval. CUPRA generally authorises in-vehicle installations of approved types of radio transmitters provided that:
? The antenna is installed correctly.
? The aerial is installed on the exterior of the vehicle (and shielded cables are used together with non-reflective aerial trimming).
? The effective transmitting power does not exceed 10 Watts at the aerial base.
A specialised CUPRA Service, SEAT Official Service or specialised workshop will be able to inform you about options for installing and op- erating radio transmitters with a higher trans- mitting power.

Mobile radio transmitters
Commercial mobile telephones or radio equip- ment might interfere with the electronics of your vehicle and cause malfunctions. This may be due to:
? No external aerial.
? External aerial incorrectly installed.
? Transmitting power more than 10 W.

Therefore you must not operate portable mo- bile telephones or radio equipment inside the vehicle without a properly installed external
aerial ›››  .
Please note also that the maximum range of the equipment can only be achieved with an external aerial.

Business equipment
Retrofit installation of business or private equipment in the vehicle is permitted, provi- ded the equipment cannot interfere with the driver's immediate control of the vehicle and that any such equipment carries the mark. Any retrofit equipment that could influence the driver's control of the vehicle must have
a type approval for your vehicle and must carry the e mark.

Warranty
 Fault-free operation warranty
Specialised CUPRA Services or SEAT Offi- cial Services ensure the perfect condition of
new vehicles. Check the purchase agreement or complementary additional documentation provided by your Technical Service for the conditions and terms of the warranty. Get fur- ther information about this from your special- ised CUPRA Service or SEAT Official Service.

Commercial warranty for high volt- age batteries for electric and hy- brid vehicles
To supplement the aforementioned warranties and guarantees, SEAT Official Services also of- fer a warranty for high voltage batteries exist- ing in many countries.
Consult the details of this warranty in the sales contract or contact a SEAT Official Service.

Information stored by the control units
Preset lists and data services
Valid in EU countries where the European Un- ion's General Data Protection Regulation ap- plies:

In-vehicle data processing
Electronic control units are installed in the ve- hicle. The control units process data which they may receive from the vehicle's sensors, generate themselves or exchange with each other. Some of them are necessary for the safe operation of the vehicle, others assist with driving (driver assistance systems) and others allow comfort functions or additional infotain- ment system functions to be provided.

Personal data references
All vehicles are identified with a unique chas- sis number. This vehicle identification number can be used to identify the current and previ- ous owners of the vehicle, e.g. in Germany by contacting the Federal Motor Vehicle Office. There are also other ways to identify the owner or driver from data taken from the vehicle, e.g. the license plate.
Therefore, the data generated or processed by the control units may be of a personal na- ture or, under certain conditions, become so.

Depending on the available vehicle data, con- clusions can be drawn about aspects such as driving style, location, route or usage patterns in certain cases.

Your data protection rights
Under current data protection legislation, you have certain rights vis-à-vis CUPRA regarding the possible processing of your personal data.
Accordingly, you are entitled to request that CUPRA or third parties, e.g. roadside assis- tance companies, workshops or providers of online services in the vehicle, inform you ex- tensively and free of charge, insofar as they have stored your personal data, about what data they hold on you and for what purpose, as well as the source of the data. You can also request information about data transfers to other parties.
Further information about your legal rights,
e.g. to delete or rectify data, can be found in the applicable legal data protection notices on the CUPRA website, including contact details and a note about the data protection officer.
With specialist help, e.g. at a workshop (for a fee, if necessary), you can view all of the data stored locally in the vehicle.


354

Information stored by the control units


Legal requirements for data disclosure
In exceptional cases, CUPRA is under the obli- gation to provide, insofar as there are legal pro- visions to this effect and to the extent neces- sary, any data in its possession at the behest of public authorities, e.g. to investigate a crime.
Public bodies are also authorised, within the framework of current legislation, to consult ve- hicle data themselves, in isolated cases. There- fore in the event of an accident, they could, for example, consult information recorded in the airbag control unit which could help to clarify the details of an accident.

Vehicle operating data
The control units process data to allow the ve- hicle to operate. For example:
? Vehicle status information, e.g. speed, de- celeration, lateral acceleration, wheel rotation, seat belt fastening indication, etc.
? Environmental circumstances, e.g. tempera- ture, rain and light sensors, distance control sensors, etc.
As a rule, this data is transitory, is not stored beyond the operating time and is only pro- cessed by the vehicle itself. The control units usually contain data memories. These memo- ries are used to temporarily or permanently document information on the status of the vehicle, maintenance requirements, technical incidents and faults, as well as to order compo- nents.


Depending on the technical equipment, the following information is stored:
? Status of system components, e.g. fill levels, tyre pressure, battery status, etc.
? Faults and defects in major system compo- nents, e.g. lights, brakes, etc.
? Reactions of systems in special driving situa- tions, e.g. when an airbag triggers, the inter- vention of stability regulation systems, etc.
? Information on incidents that could cause damage or faults in the vehicle.
In special cases, e.g. if the vehicle detects a malfunction, it may be necessary to save data that would otherwise only be kept temporarily.
When using services such as repair or mainte- nance services, the stored operating data as well as the vehicle identification number can be retrieved and used if necessary. These data can be accessed by employees of the Service network, e.g. workshops, or third parties, or employees of roadside assistance services in the event of a breakdown. This also applies to cases of warranties or the implementation of quality assurance measures.
The data is retrieved over the vehicle's OBD (On-Board-Diagnosis) connection, which is re-
quired by law ››› . Operating data document
the technical condition of the vehicle or indi- vidual components, help to diagnose faults, to fulfil legal warranty obligations and to improve quality. If necessary, these data, particularly information on component orders, technical


incidents, operating errors and other faults, are transmitted to CUPRA along with the ve- hicle identification number. In addition, the manufacturer is liable for damages caused by a defective product. CUPRA also uses vehicle operating data for this purpose, e.g. for recall campaigns. These data can also be used to
check customer claims where they wish to take advantage of a legal or commercial warranty.
Technical service workshops can reset the ve- hicle's fault memories during repair or mainte- nance work, or at your request.
Make sure that only specialised workshops re- trieve and reset the incident memories. Fur- ther information on the stored data can be ob- tained from the specialised workshops.
Once a fault has been rectified, the informa- tion on it is deleted from the memory. Other memory content is successively overwritten.

Reprogramming the control units
As a rule, all data required for component management are stored in the control units. The programming of some comfort func- tions, such as the comfort turn signals, single door opening and screen indications, can be changed by special workshop equipment. If the comfort functions are reprogrammed, the data and descriptions about these functions in this instruction manual will not match them.
CUPRA recommends that you visit one of its

dealers or a specialist workshop and ask for the reprogramming to be logged in the digital Maintenance Plan.
CUPRA dealers are aware of possible changes to the programming.

Infotainment system
Depending on the equipment you have selec- ted, you can provide data to the vehicle's info- tainment system yourself.
Depending on the equipment in question, for example:
? Media data for playing music, films or photos on an infotainment system.
? Phonebook data for use in combination with a handsfree device or navigation system.
? Entered navigation destinations.
? Data on the use of online services.
These data can be stored locally in the vehicle or on a device that you have connected to the vehicle, e.g. a mobile device, a USB drive or an MP3 player. As long as these data are stored in the vehicle, they can be deleted at any time.
These data are only passed on to third parties at your request, depending on the settings you have selected (particularly in the context of us- ing online services).



1) Not available in all markets.


Integration of mobile devices
If the vehicle has the appropriate equipment, you can connect your mobile device or other mobile terminal, if the corresponding function is available, to the vehicle so that you can con- trol them with the controls integrated in the vehicle. In this case, the image and sound from the mobile phone can be displayed and played through the infotainment system. At the same time, certain information is transmitted to your mobile device. For example, depending on the type of integration, position data and other general vehicle information. In this regard, seek more information about viewing apps in the infotainment system.
This makes it possible to use certain apps in- stalled on the mobile device, e.g. navigation or music playback. No other interaction takes
place between the mobile device and the vehi- cle. In particular there is no active access to vehicle data. The supplier of the application that is used determines the type of processing that the data subsequently undergo. Depend- ing on the app in question and the operating system of your mobile device, you may or may not be able to configure settings for this.

Online services1)
If the vehicle has a wireless network connec- tion, this makes it possible to exchange data between the vehicle and other systems. The wireless network connection is made through


the vehicle's own transmitter and receiver unit, or through your own mobile terminal, e.g. a mobile device. Online functions such as online services and apps provided by CUPRA or other providers can be used over this connection.

The manufacturer's own services
In the case of CUPRA online services, the cor- responding functions and their related data protection information are described or can be found in an appropriate place, e.g. in a sepa- rate service description or on an Internet page. Personal data may be used for the provision of online services. The data exchange takes place via a secure connection, e.g. using the manu- facturer's IT systems provided for this purpose. In the absence of legal permission, contractual agreement or consent, personal data is only collected, processed and used for the provi- sion of services.
You can activate and deactivate services and functions and, in some cases, also the vehicle's entire data connection. Special functions and services required by law, e.g. emergency call systems, are an exception to this.

Third party services
If it is possible to use online services of other providers, these providers are solely respon- sible for the services in question, and these services are subject to the data protection and




usage conditions of these providers. CUPRA has no influence over the content exchanged within the framework of these services.
Therefore, please seek information from the provider in question about the type, scope and purpose of the collection and use of personal data in the context of the services provided by the provider.



Storage of accident data (Event Data Recorder)
Your vehicle has an event data recorder (EDR).
The EDR's function is to record data in the event of a mild or serious accident. These data are used to support the analysis of how differ- ent vehicle systems behaved.

The EDR records, over a reduced time range (normally 10 seconds or less), dynamic driving data and data from the restraint systems, such as:
? How different vehicle systems worked.
? Whether the driver and the occupants were wearing their seat belts.
? How hard the accelerator or brake pedal was pressed.
? Vehicle speed.
These data will provide a better understanding of the circumstances of the accident.
Data from the driving assist systems are also recorded. This includes data such as whether the systems were inactive or active and if such action had an impact on the vehicle's dynamic behaviour, changing its path in the aforemen- tioned situations, or accelerating or decelerat- ing the vehicle.
Depending on vehicle equipment, this in- cludes data from systems such as:
? the adaptive cruise control
? the lane assist system
? the park assist systems
? the emergency brake functions.
The EDR data are only recorded in specific ac- cident situations. No data are recorded in nor- mal driving conditions.
No audio or video data inside or around the vehicle are recorded. Under no circumstances are personal data such as name, age, or gen-

der recorded. Nevertheless, third parties (such as criminal proceedings authorities) may relate the contents of the EDR data to other data sources and create a personal reference in the context of an accident investigation.
In order to read the EDR data it is necessary
to access (if legally permitted to do so) the ve- hicle's ODB ("On-Board-Diagnose") interface while the vehicle is switched on.
In addition to the vehicle manufacturer, third parties, such as judicial organisations with the appropriate tools, may be able to access the information if they have access to the vehicle or to the data recorded in the EDR.
CUPRA will not have access to EDR data unless the owner (or, in "Leasing" cases, the lessee or hirer) gives their consent. There may be exceptions to this, depending on legal or con- tractual provisions.
Due to legal requirements in safety-related products, CUPRA may use the EDR data for field research and in order to improve vehicle system quality. Any data used for research pur- poses will be treated anonymously (in other words, no reference will be made to the vehi- cle, its owner or the lessee/hirer).

Return and scrapping of end-of-life vehicles
End-of-life return
At the end of its useful life, your vehicle must be recycled and disposed of in an environmen- tally sound manner. For this reason, final vehi- cle owners in the EU and in many other coun- tries are required by law to take their vehicle to an authorised collection point, vehicle return centre or authorised dismantling facility.
CUPRA has already made the necessary ar- rangements for this: an extensive network of vehicle return centres is available throughout the EU and in many other countries, where you can drop off your vehicle. If you meet the na- tional legal requirements, you can return your end-of-life vehicle free of charge within the EU.
The vehicle return centre issues a recycling certificate which serves as proof that the end- of-life vehicle has been recycled correctly.
Information about the Vehicle Return Centres can be obtained from your CUPRA dealer.

Scrapping
The relevant safety requirements must be ob- served when scrapping the vehicle or its in- dividual components, e.g. airbag system and seatbelt tensioners. Qualified workshops are already familiar with these requirements. CU- PRA recommends using a CUPRA dealer.

Technical data
Indications about the technical data
Vehicle identification data
The values indicated in the technical data may differ depending on optional equipment or version of the model, as well as in the case
of special vehicles and equipment for certain countries.
The information in the official vehicle docu- mentation takes precedence at all times.

Abbreviations used in the Technical Specifi- cations section

Vehicle Identification Number (VIN)
Depending on the version you can find the frame number in the following places:
? In the infotainment system using the func- tion button	Vehicle > Status > Service.
? Front, visible through the small window on the lower left side of the windscreen.
? Behind the front right seat, under the floor covering.
? On the vehicle's data label.
? On the right in the front compartment.

Type plate
The type plate is located on the vehicle's right hand door frame. Vehicles for certain export countries do not have a type plate.

Performance
The values apply only to optimal road and weather conditions.
The vehicle's performance has been calcula- ted without any equipment that would affect it,
e.g. accessories.

Weights
The kerb weight values apply to a vehicle that is ready to drive with a driver (75 kg), oper- ating fluids and, if applicable, tools and the spare wheel. The kerb weight increases with

optional equipment and retrofitting of acces- sories, which reduce the possible payload ac- cordingly.

Load on the roof
The maximum authorised load on the roof of your vehicle is 75 kg.

Trailer weight
The maximum permitted drawbar load on the ball head of the towing bracket is 80 kg.
